<p>The work that Bishop Selwyn did in laying the
foundations of the Church in New Zealand, and
his views as to Church organization have special
lessons to teach us in these days. It is to
bring these lessons to the notice of those who
are unable to study larger biographies that this
short life has been written.</p>
<p>No one can write about Bishop Selwyn without
expressing great indebtedness to the Rev.
H. W. Tucker whose <i>Memoir</i> of the Bishop,
founded on the letters and papers entrusted to
him by the Bishop&rsquo;s family, contains most of
what can be known about him. In this little
book I have freely used Mr. Tucker&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>,
indeed the book could not have been written
without it. I have consulted many other books
bearing on the history of New Zealand and
Melanesia, but my object has been to write
about Selwyn, and about New Zealand and
Melanesia only so far as they concerned him.
I have tried to show what manner of man he
was by telling of what he did and said, and to
let him reveal himself by his own words and
by his letters, rather than to attempt to explain
him in my own words. I cannot claim to have
had access to any new material, I have only
selected from what is already published that
which will enable my readers to learn something
of the life and work of a man of distinguished
gifts and a great leader in the Church.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>The life of George Augustus Selwyn has many
lessons to teach us. In the position which he
was called upon to fill, there were exceptional
opportunities which his own natural gifts
enabled him to meet in an exceptional way.
He showed himself to be not only a devoted
missionary and a capable organizer, but a
statesman, able to grasp a big situation and to
lay wise foundations for the future. As a
missionary bishop, he had the care of a specially
virile and promising race in the Maoris, and of
the other very varied races that inhabited the
countless islands of the Pacific. But he had also
to provide for the spiritual needs of the colonists
who came to his diocese in ever growing
numbers, attracted by the rich promise of New
Zealand. The claims made upon his time and
thought by the colonists, the Maoris and the
islanders had all to be met and adjusted, and
in the midst of all the urgent demands for the
pressing work of each moment, he had to be
building up the church of the future. He could
not think only of the native Church. His call
was not only to be a missionary, to bring the
heathen to Christ, but also to lay the foundations
of a Church which was to witness to Christ in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
land destined for a great future, as part of the
British Empire. He had to consider how black
and white could be welded into one nation, and
into one Church. His could not be the simple
straightforward task of the teacher or the evangelist.
Yet he was ever at heart a missionary,
animated by a true sense of vocation. There are
those whose own life of devotion and service is
their chief witness for Christ, their great gift to
His Church; but Selwyn was called to do more
than witness for Christ by his life and his individual
work. His work as an organizer was inspired
by a desire for efficiency, for making the best use
in God&rsquo;s service of the men and the money
entrusted to his care. But more than this, he had
ever before him a vision of what the Church in
New Zealand should be in the future. He saw
it a Church, founded on the best traditions of
the past, able to grow and expand to meet all
the needs of the future, in communion with the
Anglican Church throughout the world, that
Church which he believed by its origin and
history to be the branch of the Catholic Church
best fitted to the genius of the Anglo-Saxon
people. Rooted in the past, throbbing with
the active life of the present, ready to meet the
great possibilities of the future, the Church was
the inspiration of all his efforts. But in his
devotion to the whole, he never lost sight of the
individual. It is the combination of far reaching
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
views with tender care for each individual
soul which gives him his special charm and
makes him so valuable an example for others.
Organization was never to him an object in
itself. In the midst of big schemes, struggling
with big plans, there was no service however
menial that he was not eager to render to any
sufferer however humble, there was no task
however arduous that he was not ready to
undertake. He lived intensely, and though life
was to him a constant act of self-surrender, he
could rejoice in it and in all that it brought to
him of beauty, interest and affection.</p>

<br /><span class="smaller">CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH</span></h2>
<p>George Augustus Selwyn had all the advantages
of birth and education which would
have made a brilliant career in England easy
for him. He came of a distinguished family,
and his father, a successful lawyer, was in a
position to give him every educational advantage.
Born in 1809, he was the second of four
brothers, who all had brilliant school and college
careers. His energy, his capacity for rule,
his sympathy showed itself even when he was a
boy. His sister says, &ldquo;he was truly the family
friend and counsellor, ever ready to help in all
difficulties.&rdquo; A specially tender tie bound him
to his mother; she suffered grievously from
nervous depression and he gave up much time
in his holidays to cheering her. By her bedside
he probably learned that tender care for the
suffering which marked him throughout life.
At the early age of seven he was sent to a large
preparatory school at Ealing, and from there
went on to Eton where he was said to be the
best boy on the river, nearly the first boy in
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
learning and the greatest diver in the school.
His exact scholarship and his skill in swimming
and diving were all alike capacities which helped
to fit him for his future life. Very popular in
the school and distinguished in athletics, he
never neglected his studies. One of his friends
says that &ldquo;he seemed to be always preparing
himself for some unrevealed future of usefulness.&rdquo;
It was the same when he went on to St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, in 1827, and entered with
his usual ardour into both the studies and the
sports of the university. Mathematics were
very distasteful to him and in the class list of
1831 he was only a <i>junior optime</i>, but he was the
second classic of his year. He rowed in the
Cambridge boat in the first Oxford and Cambridge
boat race.</p>
<p>When he left Cambridge, he spent four
months in travel on the continent and returned
to Eton as private tutor to the sons of Lord
Powis. The same energetic life of work and
play was continued in his new position at Eton.
He it was who persuaded Dr. Hawtrey to draw
up rules for bathing and boating on the river.
Till then there had been no rules, and the river
was considered out of bounds. He wished the
boys to have freedom to enjoy the river, but to
be obliged to learn to swim before they boated.
He himself loved boating and long walks,
finding his way across country by a compass;
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
he took part in steeplechases, and so learned
to ride horses of all kinds over rough country.
Whilst he enjoyed all these varied occupations
which were to prove a preparation for the life
before him, he had as yet not the slightest idea
of going to work abroad. A letter written many
years afterwards (1850) to his son shows how
uncertain he was as a young man about his future
career. &ldquo;I remember that at your age, though I
had some desire for the ministerial office I had not
any fixed or devoted purpose of heart to undertake
its duties, nor any steadfast resolution to
frame my life so as to make it a preparation for
it. It pleased God that much of the restless
energy which then found its vent in mere
amusement and running to and fro, as it
seemed without point or aim, was a training of
which I have since felt the value, to enable me
to do the work of an evangelist in seeking out
the sheep of Christ that are scattered over a
thousand hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long he began to study Hebrew and
theology in preparation for his ordination
which took place in 1833. Still remaining a
tutor at Eton, he worked first as curate of
Boveney and later at the Windsor Parish
Church, giving up the curate&rsquo;s salary for two
years in order to help the financial difficulties
of the parish. The spirit in which he worked is
shown by the following remark in a letter to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
friend: &ldquo;I believe that as clergymen we
ought to be willing to be tied like furze bushes
to a donkey&rsquo;s tail, if we can thereby do any good
by stimulating what is lazy and quickening what
is slow.&rdquo; He threw himself with zeal into
every part of the work of his parish, developing
new organizations of many kinds. By his
devotion as well as by his preaching he won the
warm affection of the parishioners, and together
with all this parish work he kept up a close
connexion with Eton. His old schoolfellow
W. E. Gladstone, said of him: &ldquo;he was
attached to Eton with a love surpassing the
love of Etonians. In himself he formed a large
part of the life of Eton, and Eton formed a large
part of his life.&rdquo; Always a great organizer,
he had much influence both amongst masters
and boys, at a time when various reforms were
being introduced into the school. The impression
he made was of one who had a high
ideal of personal and Christian life, not an
ascetic, but one who valued bodily training and
plain living, because they conduced to success
in good work.</p>
<p>In 1839 Selwyn married Sarah Richardson,
daughter of Sir J. Richardson, a judge of the
Court of Common Pleas, in whom he found a
companion ready to share with him all the risks
and difficulties of an adventurous life. At
the time of his marriage there seemed no prospect
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
before him beyond that of a successful
ecclesiastical career in England. Full of work,
full of zeal, with many friends, living in a place
that he loved, and now with a happy home of his
own, he was absolutely content with life.
But it was ever his firm conviction that an
officer in the Church was as much bound as an
officer in the army, to obey the command of his
superior and to go wherever he was sent.
On his marriage he asked his wife never to
oppose his going wherever he might be ordered
on duty.</p>
<p>At that time the authorities of the Church
were seriously considering the need of increasing
the number of bishops in the colonies, since
every year more emigrants left England for the
newly settled lands beyond the seas. Amongst
the leaders of the Church there were men who
were determined that there should be no
repetition of the past shameful neglect which had
left the American colonies so long without
a bishop of their own. The matter was brought
forward by Bishop Blomfield of London, and a
Colonial Bishoprics Fund was started. Thirteen
countries were named as most urgently in need
of Bishops, and amongst these New Zealand
stood first. The Church Missionary Society
had had missions established there since 1814,
and Bishop Broughton of Australia had once
been able to visit them, but could not do so
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
again. The most experienced of the New Zealand
missionaries, Henry Williams, wrote in
1841 &ldquo;Many questions of moment frequently
present themselves, on which we possess no
authority to enter. We much hope that a
Bishop for this colony will soon make his
appearance.&rdquo; The formation in 1839 of the New
Zealand Company, with the object of buying
up land from the natives and encouraging
settlers, had brought with it many new problems
and difficulties. The need for a Bishop as head
of the Church which was called to minister both
to Maoris and settlers was recognized by all.
The Church Missionary Society promised &pound;600
a year for his support and it was hoped that the
Government would give a like sum. The Crown
was to appoint the Bishop. The first name
suggested was that of Professor Selwyn, George
Selwyn&rsquo;s elder brother, but he felt unable to
leave his Cambridge professorship. The
bishopric was then offered to George Selwyn in
a letter from the Bishop of London to which
Selwyn, who had no personal desire for such an
office and who had no wish to change his actual
work, answered as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever part in the work of the ministry the
Church of England as represented by her Archbishops
and Bishops may call upon me to undertake, I trust
I shall be willing to accept with all obedience and
humility. The same reasons which would prevent
me from seeking the office of a bishop, forbid me to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
decline an authoritative invitation to a post so full
of responsibility, but at the same time of spiritual
promise.... It has never seemed to me to lie in the
power of an individual to choose the field of labour
most suited to his own powers. Those who are the
eyes of the Church and have seen him acting in the
station in which God has placed him, are the best
judges whether he &lsquo;ought to go up higher.&rsquo; Whether
the advancement be at home or abroad ... with
whatever prospects or adjuncts of emolument or
dignity or without any, the only course seems to be
to undertake it at the bidding of the proper authority
and to endeavour to execute it with all faithfulness....
Allow me to offer my best thanks to your Lordship
for your kind letter and to place myself unreservedly
in the hands of the Episcopal Council to dispose my
services as they may think best for the Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual offer had to be made by Lord
John Russell and meanwhile doubts had arisen
whether Parliament would be willing to grant
the money proposed towards the Bishop&rsquo;s
stipend, but this uncertainty did not influence
Selwyn&rsquo;s decision. There were other difficulties
which weighed more with him. A colonial
bishop was in those days appointed under
Letters Patent from the Crown, and these were
so worded as to make it appear that the bishop&rsquo;s
right to exercise the spiritual functions of his
office was derived solely from the Crown.
Selwyn could do no more than make a formal
protest against such wording. An absurd
blunder was also made in the Letters Patent
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
through the ignorance of the Colonial Office,
and jurisdiction was given to the Bishop over
sixty-eight more degrees of latitude than was
intended. In this way it came about that
Melanesia was included in the diocese of New
Zealand.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Company was ready to make
grants of land for the purposes of the Church,
but under conditions which should ensure that
their property was benefited through the Church.
They wished the Bishop to settle on the land
they gave, and he was told that his future
popularity would be sacrificed if he did not make
his home and build his cathedral at the place
they indicated. But Selwyn was going to
promise nothing until he had himself studied
the country. He said that he would &ldquo;rent a
house for his family and pitch a tent near to it
a soon as he landed and the very next day
begin daily service, never he hoped to be
interrupted. He meant then to go away and
visit all the islands and when his choice was made
to move his tent thither and continue the
services, and by its side build a wooden church,
and outside of the wooden building to begin to
build a chancel of stone in Norman style, and
as soon as any part of the stone cathedral was
finished the wooden work would be taken down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the very first he wished to have some
holy place set apart for the daily service of God,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and he carefully superintended the making of the
church tent which was to be the first cathedral
of the island church.</p>
<p>Amidst the important questions that occupied
his mind during these busy weeks of preparation,
details were not forgotten. His sister remembers
&ldquo;sitting up half the night helping
him to make a water proof belt for his watch
and pedometer. He meant to swim the rivers,
pushing his clothes in front of him.&rdquo; During
all his preparations the thought of the great
spiritual work to which he was dedicating his
life filled his thoughts. One who was with
him at the time writes: &ldquo;He said the &lsquo;Consecration
Service&rsquo; had lately been his constant
study, and that after next Sunday (his Consecration
day) his existence as an individual
must cease, and that all his own individual
interests and ties must undergo the change with
him. Sarah (his wife) knelt down beside him and
looking up in his face said, &lsquo;I know at any rate
you will not love me any the less.&rsquo; He stroked
back the hair from her forehead, kissed it,
saying, &lsquo;Surely not the less but the more.&rsquo;
He went on to explain that what he meant was
&lsquo;that his very being, with all its powers and
affections must now be dedicated to God in a
more peculiar and solemn degree than heretofore,
and be absorbed into higher powers and
boundless affections.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>He was consecrated on October 17th in the
Chapel at Lambeth Palace. It was not yet
the custom to hold consecrations in the Abbey
or at S. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. There was not room
for the many friends who wished to be with him
in the Chapel, which was crowded as it had
never been before on such an occasion. Exceptional
interest was felt in his going forth,
due to the affection and admiration with which
he was regarded by so many, and to the sense
of the brilliant prospects at home that he was
gladly giving up to go to a distant land only just
emerging from barbarism.</p>
<p>Two days after his Consecration, Selwyn
received an offer from the Rev. C. J. Abraham,
one of the ablest Eton masters, to come and work
with him in New Zealand as soon as he could be
free from the special work he had undertaken at
Eton. To this offer Selwyn answered at once:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite overwhelmed with joy at your letter and
have just risen from my knees after having poured forth
my thankfulness to God.... When I think of the position
in which the course of His providence has placed me ...
I tremble at the thought of my weakness, and though I
know the sufficiency of Divine Grace, still I long for
brethren of a like mind to share with me the labours and
the joys of the coming harvest. Men talk of sacrifices
as a loss. I thank God that the enlarged comprehension
of His scheme of mercy, which He has lately given me, has
made me feel that no worldly advancement could compensate
for the loss of one single moment of the peaceful
and thankful and yet humble state of mind which I have
enjoyed since the scales of all earthly objects of desire fell
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
from my eyes.... I encourage you to cherish the feelings
in which your letter was written, to dwell upon them; and
in the end to act upon them; not on the spur of the present
occasion, but with the calm, deep and deliberate devotion
of a balanced judgment. Men think enthusiasm necessary
to missionary enterprise. May we be enabled to show that
the highest range of spiritual thought, the most entire and
uncompromising obedience to the letter of the Gospel,
being no more than our bounden duty, is compatible with
the most perfect evenness of mind, and with the subdued
and rational exercise of the understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being called to the Episcopate at an early age I feel
at liberty to look forward to a long course of pastoral
superintendence over the Church in New Zealand. In
that course many great and important changes must occur,
for which I must be prepared.... Could I find a few men
like yourself, who would silently work with me by the
devotion of themselves and their means to the same cause,
we should see year after year, parish after parish, archdeaconry
after archdeaconry start into life, not with the
mere appurtenances of temporal endowment, but with the
provision of a living hand to give life and spirit to the
institution.... Will you be one of the feeders of my
Church, with the view of being in the course of time one of
its pastors?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the farewell days spent at Eton and
Windsor many friends gathered to show him
their affection and to do him honour. At a
meeting held in Windsor, he spoke again of the
motives which had made him ready to go forth
and of his readiness to go anywhere he might
be sent, and of his deep thankfulness because
&ldquo;that land of promise, New Zealand, a land
literally flowing with milk and honey, was to
be his.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The party that was to accompany the Bishop
and his wife and child to New Zealand, consisted
of his two chaplains, Mr. Cotton, Student of
Christ Church, Oxford and Mr. Whytehead, Fellow
of St. John&rsquo;s, Cambridge, three missionary
clergy, three catechists and two school teachers.
Mrs. (afterwards Lady) Martin, wife of the
first Chief Justice of New Zealand, travelled
with them to join her husband. The Chief
Justice, who had gone out a few months before,
came to be one of Selwyn&rsquo;s chief helpers and
friends. The spirit in which he had entered
upon his work is shown by the fact that he had
impressed upon his wife that &ldquo;the aborigines
of their new country were to be worked for and
cared for.&rdquo; The voyage to New Zealand was
in those days of course undertaken in a sailing
ship, and the party were delayed some days at
Plymouth waiting for a favourable wind. Those
relatives and friends who had come to see them
off were obliged one by one to leave. The
Bishop settled himself in the ship on Christmas
eve and held his first service on board on Christmas
day. On the next day after prayers with
those friends that remained, the last farewells
were said and the little ship <i>Tomatin</i> was off
on its long voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">EARLY MISSIONS IN NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p>Selwyn might speak of New Zealand as a land
of promise, but he knew well that it had not yet
emerged from barbarism. Its inhabitants, the
Maoris, were a race splendidly gifted both
physically and intellectually, but they were
constantly involved in internecine warfare,
tribe fighting against tribe, and all alike delighting
to feast on the bodies of their captured
foes. New Zealand had been discovered by
Jasman, the Dutch navigator, in 1642, but no
European had landed on the islands till Captain
Cook sailed round them in 1769. His reports
led to visits from traders, whose treacherous
treatment of the natives was followed by cruel
retaliations, so that the Maoris got a very bad
reputation for barbarism. Their intercourse
with some of the settlers in New South Wales,
brought them to the notice of Samuel Marsden,
a Government chaplain sent out to the convicts
in Botany Bay. Marsden was a true evangelist,
labouring under most adverse conditions and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
face of bitter opposition, to do what he could
for the unhappy convicts. His heart was
large enough to make him wish to help the
Maoris also. He welcomed such of them as
came over to New South Wales to his house in
Paramatta, and put up huts for them in his
garden, where sometimes he had as many as
thirty at once. One of the Maori chiefs struck
by what he saw of more civilized ways, implored
Marsden to send someone to teach his
countrymen, and when Marsden Visited England
in 1806 he went to the office of the Church
Missionary Society and told the committee of
the rich field that New Zealand offered for their
work. The C.M.S. was then in its infancy.
So far it had only sent out five missionaries, who
had gone to West Africa. Marsden asked them
to send three mechanics to New Zealand. He
thought then that the first thing to do was to
teach the Maoris something of the arts of
civilised life. It was not long before he discovered
his mistake and realized that the first
thing needed was the work of the evangelist,
and that it was through the teaching of the
Gospel that the foundations of an ordered life
must be laid. At first the mission seemed
doomed to failure, but Marsden never lost
heart, till in 1822 Henry Williams, the man who
was to lay the foundations of Christianity in
New Zealand, was sent out with his wife and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
two children. He had been an officer in the
navy before his ordination, and his knowledge
of seafaring ways proved of immense use in his
new work. The C.M.S. sent him out with the
injunction &ldquo;to bring the noble but benighted
race of New Zealanders into the enjoyment of
the light and freedom of the Gospel.&rdquo; With
this object he laboured till his death in 1867,
never once returning to England. Neither did
Marsden forget the Mission. He visited New
Zealand seven times, giving constant help and
encouragement to the missionaries. His devoted
work earned for him the title of the
Apostle of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Henry Williams with his wife and children
settled on the Bay of Islands, in the North
East of New Zealand, at Paihai, a great resort
of whalers. It was in this district that most of
the early missions were established, Wesleyan
and Roman Catholic as well as Anglican.
Henry Williams was soon after joined by his
brother William, and together, with wives and
families they lived for nine years at Paihai.
William showed at once an extraordinary aptitude
for learning the language. His brother
said of him he &ldquo;appears not to learn it but
it seems to flow naturally from him.&rdquo; His
presence at Paihai enabled Henry to travel and
visit distant parts of the island with the view
of extending the mission. The experiences
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
of these two brothers and their families belong
to the romance of missions. They gained a
remarkable knowledge of the Maoris and their
customs, and won a great influence over them.
Absolutely fearless in the way in which they
exposed themselves to danger, they were often
able to make peace between the tribes in the
fierce conflicts which were constantly breaking
out. The wrongdoing of an individual was
punished by the most bloody vengeance on his
whole tribe, and defeated enemies were killed
and eaten. Unfortunately fire-arms had been
introduced among the Maoris by the traders,
and this made their warfare much more deadly.
They hoped at first that the missionaries also
would provide them with fire-arms, and by
refusing to do so, the Williams were at the
beginning reduced to great privations for want
of food. They not only refused to give fire-arms
in exchange for the necessaries of life,
but never carried them themselves. The Maoris
soon recognized the difference between them
and the traders, but the beginnings of the
mission were full of dangers and difficulties.</p>
<p>The savage attacks of the Maoris threatened
several times to destroy the mission, but amidst
all dangers, not only to himself but to his wife
and children, Williams remained calm and
unafraid. He gained an amazing personal
ascendency over the Maoris, and exposed himself
fearlessly again and again in order to stop their
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
feuds and bring an end to their repeated and
cruel wars. It was not only the Maoris he had
to fear, he met with much opposition from the
settlers also, who objected to the efforts of the
missionaries to secure fair treatment for the
natives, and threatened to turn them out of the
country. Williams was in no hurry to make
converts. He would have no hasty baptisms.
For each there must be a long period of probation;
but when, after due preparation and
testing, the first had been baptized, the number
of Christians increased rapidly. Williams gave
himself with great energy to language study.
He found the Maori dialects very corrupt and
difficult to reduce to order. In this work he was
greatly helped by his brother William, who was
an Oxford scholar, and who helped to fix the
language and give it its grammar. Portions
of the Bible were translated and the Maoris,
old chiefs as well as young boys, after being
taught in the schools set up by the missionaries,
became eager readers.</p>
<p>It was the constant recurrence of native wars
that weighed most heavily upon Williams&rsquo;
mind. In 1832, he wrote of himself as &ldquo;in
much distress of mind at the present state of
things in this land. All is dark, dreary and in
dire confusion.&rdquo; But he was not often cast
down. The chief mission station, Paihai in
the Waimate, where he lived, was a centre
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
of education and industry. Charles Darwin,
visiting it during his voyage in the <i>Beagle</i> in
1835, wrote of it: &ldquo;The lesson of the missionary
is the enchanter&rsquo;s wand. I thought the whole
scene admirable and to think that this was the
centre of cannibalism, murder and all atrocious
crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time some of the most bloodthirsty old
chiefs died and the young ones were more ready
to listen to the new teaching. They became
eager readers of the Bible, they attended the
schools, were ready to learn simple handicrafts
and after their baptism gave up their desire
to fight and seek revenge for every provocation.</p>
<p>After a time the missionaries who now had
amongst their converts some who were eager to
help in the work of teaching, were able to start
other missions further south than the Bay of
Islands, in the neighbourhood of the Waikato
and the Thames rivers. Richard Taylor, one
of the early missionaries, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Gospel could not have made the progress it did or
have obtained such a permanent hold upon the native mind,
had it not been for the agency of the native teachers.
In many places they were the first bearers of the Gospel,
and some laid down their lives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1838 Bishop Broughton came from Australia
to confirm the candidates taught and prepared
by the missionaries. He reported to the C.M.S.
committee at home on the flourishing condition
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
of the Mission. The Christians were said to
number thirty thousand, and Bishop Broughton
urged the desirability of sending out a Bishop
to superintend the work of the Church in New
Zealand. The special conditions of the country
demanded that the influence of the Church
should be felt in all the new circumstances that
were arising. Settlers were pouring in, many
of them convicts from Australia, unprincipled
men with no desire for anything but their own
gain. Contact with them was teaching the
Maoris their evil ways, and leading to much
corruption and drunkenness. To the settlers
the natives with their old established customs
of land tenure, their great attachment to their
lands, and their constant tendency to fight for
their rights, were hindrances in their way.
They desired only to exterminate them. The
home government realized that this was not a
state of affairs that could be left to settle itself.
In the interests of peace, they determined that
New Zealand must be made into a British
Colony. This was strongly opposed by the
C.M.S. who encouraged by the progress that
Christianity had made amongst the Maoris,
believed that before long the whole people would
become Christian and believed that the arrival of
colonists would only disturb the peaceful development
of the natives. It was, however, impossible
to imagine that a country as full of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
resources as New Zealand could be left to its
scanty native population. Settlers were sure
to come, and it was better for all that a good
and stable government should be set up in the
land. An English officer, Captain Hobson, was
therefore sent out to enter into peaceful negotiations
with the chiefs, in order to establish
the sovereignty of the Queen in New Zealand.
This was not an easy matter, for the chiefs
feared that to agree to this would mean that
they would have to give up to the Queen of
England the ownership of their lands. They
had heard of what had happened in other
countries and how the people had been reduced
to the position of slaves by the coming of the
white settlers. A great gathering of the chiefs
was held at Waitangi early in 1840, when Captain
Hobson explained to them what was proposed,
and told them that &ldquo;the shadow would go to
the Queen and the substance would remain,
and that they might rely implicitly on the good
faith of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.&rdquo; The
question was long discussed. The missionaries
urged the chiefs to trust in the words of Captain
Hobson. At last one of the chiefs said to him,
&ldquo;You must be our father, you must not allow
us to become slaves; you must preserve our
customs, and never permit our land to be wrested
from us,&rdquo; and the majority of the chiefs ended
by signing the treaty of Waitangi. Captain
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Hobson fixed the seat of government for the
new colony at Auckland in the northern island,
where the Maori population was densest, and
which possessed splendid water communications
in every direction.</p>
<p>The implications of the Treaty of Waitangi
were by no means recognised by the settlers
who were arriving in New Zealand in ever
increasing numbers. They were attracted by
the promises of the New Zealand Land Company.
The Company had little understanding of the
Maori customs of land tenure. It ignored the
fact that in the opinion of the Maoris the
whole land already had owners, with boundaries
well known to the different chiefs, and it sold
lands to intending settlers before it had duly
acquired their ownership. In consequence, there
were abundant possibilities for discontent on
the part of emigrants when they arrived to take
possession of lands which they believed were
theirs by purchase, and for hostility on the part
of the natives who felt that they had been
betrayed. In this way the seeds of many future
wars were sown.</p>
<p>In those early days of the life of the colony,
natives and settlers alike needed Christian
teaching and education to show them how to live
in peace and develop the country. The newly
set up government needed help from those who
had lived and worked amongst the natives, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
their important task of establishing order and
justice. New Zealand with its beautiful climate
and its rich resources was bound to become a
great and prosperous country. It was necessary
that the foundations of its future greatness
should be laid in principles of righteousness and
justice. The labours of Marsden, the two
Williams and others had established Christianity
throughout New Zealand, what was needed now
was organization to make their work permanent.
Selwyn as he viewed the task before him felt
the full joy of a born organizer and administrator.
He wrote, &ldquo;I find myself placed in a
position such as was never granted to any
English Bishop before, with a power to mould
the institutions of the Church from the beginning
according to true principles.&rdquo; The ground was
well prepared for his work. The year before his
arrival Henry Williams could write, &ldquo;The
whole fabric of native superstition is gone&mdash;their
weapons of warfare are laid by&mdash;their
petty quarrels are settled by arbitration.&rdquo; It
was a too sanguine view as later events showed,
but that it could be held at all was a sign of how
much had been done.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p>Bishop Selwyn and his party left Plymouth on
December 26th, 1841, in the <i>Tomatin</i>. The
long voyage in a sailing vessel was spent in
preparing for the work that was before them.
To Selwyn&rsquo;s great joy there was a Maori boy on
board who could be used to teach him and his
party the Maori language. Lady Martin thus
describes the voyage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We had a quiet, prosperous voyage in a small barque
which would be thought very squeezy nowadays. We had
none of the modern luxuries required in steamers&mdash;no fresh
bread, no stewardess to wait on us, no delicate fare. But we
had compensations of an unusual kind. If we had plain
living, we certainly had the opportunity of high thinking.
Our party consisted of the Bishop of New Zealand, his two
chaplains, both men of great gifts, and other clergymen and
students. There were daily classes after breakfast for
all who wished to learn the native language. There was
no printed Maori grammar, only a manuscript grammar
and vocabulary, and copies of S. Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel, just
printed by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.
But we had a walking dictionary in a Maori boy, who had
been brought to England by a gentleman and sent to school
for two years. He was not a favourable specimen, for he
had been the plaything of the servant&rsquo;s hall in holiday time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and had little more than superficial civilization. However,
he was very useful on board, and undertook to teach correct
pronunciation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop writes in a letter to his mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday, January 3rd, we began regular habits;
reading the daily prayers at eight in the morning, and the
Psalms and Lessons, in the original languages, each at their
appointed hour. Besides this, there is a New Zealand class,
comprising nearly all the party, and a mathematical class
for the study of navigation. The whole of the morning is
thus occupied, leaving the evening to the discretion of the
party, and for preparation for the next day. On Church
festivals when the full service is read, the Eton practice
of a whole holiday is followed. The advantage of this
regular plan is generally admitted, as, instead of the voyage
being tedious, very few find the day long enough. We
have taken different departments for the study of the New
Zealand language. Mr. Cotton and Mr. Reay are making
a Concordance of the native Testament. I am compiling
from the Rarotonga, Tahitian and New Zealand translations
of the New Testament, a Comparative Grammar of
those three dialects, which are all from the same root and
illustrate one another. I hope to be quite familiar with
the three dialects by the end of the voyage, which will
much facilitate the plan which I have conceived&mdash;and which
may God give me grace to carry into effect&mdash;of extending
the branches of the Church of New Zealand throughout the
Southern Pacific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am studying practical navigation under our captain
in order that I may be my own <i>Master</i> in my visitation
voyages.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the clergy of the party was appointed
as chaplain to the steerage passengers, two
others as chaplains to the crew. There were
daily prayers in the steerage, and the steerage
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
passengers attended all the public services.
In Holy Week one of the six clergy on board
was chosen to preach every day, and on a lovely
Easter day, service was held on the quarterdeck
when thirty-four communicated.</p>
<p>On April 10th Selwyn was able to write to his
mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can now converse with Rupai fluently in New
Zealand. My navigation has prospered, so that I can
now find the ship&rsquo;s latitude and longitude, and shape her
course.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 14th, 1842, the ship reached Sydney.
There Selwyn had the opportunity of meeting
Bishop Broughton and learning from him something
about the affairs of the Church in this new
world. Broughton was filled with affection
and respect by what he saw of the new Bishop,
and inspired with great hopes for the work he
might be able to accomplish.</p>
<p>The <i>Tomatin</i> had received some damage in
going up Sydney harbour, and the Bishop was
too impatient to wait till its repairs were
completed. He succeeded in chartering a small
brig to convey him and a few others of his
party to New Zealand, without waiting for the
<i>Tomatin</i>. There had been those who dreaded
the coming of a bishop, thinking that the
conditions of New Zealand were not suitable
for an ecclesiastical dignitary. Captain Hobson
had said: &ldquo;What can a bishop do in New
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Zealand, where there are no roads for his
coach?&rdquo; The Bishop&rsquo;s conduct soon dispelled
all doubts. He landed at Auckland on May 31st.
His first act on reaching the shore was to kneel
down on the sands and give thanks to God.
On the following Sunday, to the delight of all,
he said prayers and preached in Maori. The
next place he visited was Paihai, and Mrs.
Williams thus describes his arrival in her diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While Henry was engaged with his Bible class, William
came in and exclaimed: &lsquo;the Bishop of New Zealand on
the beach!&rsquo; He went down and found the Bishop
dragging up a boat in which they had come from Cape
Brett, steering for this house with a pocket compass. The
Bishop&rsquo;s manner was most prepossessing. When summoned
to tea, both the Bishop and his Chaplain seemed
surprised at the long tea table of the two families of Williams,
set for twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Williams himself wrote to a friend on
June 24th, 1842:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop is now in my house having landed after
dark on Monday evening last. We were all taken by
surprise and put into an immediate bustle. I was delighted
to see his face and to hear him speak and was
relieved from many forebodings. I have seen very much
of this good man during the few days of his sojourn amongst
us. We have spoken freely upon various subjects in
connexion with the Mission, and it is very remarkable that
in no one instance have we had a contrary idea. He so
fully enters into our views upon all missionary points, that
I am at times under some apprehension of forgetting that
he is our Bishop.... We are all of us delighted at the
knowledge the Bishop has obtained of our language. He
can to the surprise of all converse with ease and directness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
The Bishop observes moreover that he shall require all
his clergy to acquire the language, that they may attend
to the natives.... I feel fully satisfied to leave all the
affairs of the Mission or my own as a missionary in his
hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another letter he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He has captivated every heart by his kindness and courteous
manners.... I am persuaded that nothing will
escape his notice, however trifling the circumstance....
He is now going to make a tour of the Island visiting every
station.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of his first Sunday at Paihai the Bishop
himself writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I administered the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to one hundred and
fifty native communicants and was much struck with their
orderly and reverential demeanour. All were dressed in
European clothing, and, with the exception of their colour,
presented the appearance of an English congregation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop spent several days with this
experienced missionary learning all he could
from him about the condition of the country,
about the complicated land question, and about
the different mission stations. All that he
observed and learned helped him to mature his
plans for the future. He had chosen to be
called Bishop of New Zealand because he did
not wish, by taking the title for his see from
one particular settlement to provoke the
jealousy of others. But it was necessary to
decide where he should fix his residence. The
New Zealand Company wished him to go to
Wellington where they had secured a great
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
deal of land and the agent went so far as to tell
him that if he decided to settle at Auckland,
instead of being looked upon by them with
affectionate regard as their best friend, he would
be regarded coldly as a prop of a rival
settlement. Auckland was then the seat of
government, though what was in a few years
to become a beautiful city was still only a
cluster of huts. Lady Martin described it as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Government House was only a one-storied cottage
standing back from the road. A few wooden houses
were dotted about, in which the Government officials
lived. There were wooden barracks which contained
about fifty soldiers; a supreme court-house, where the
Judge held his court in the week, and which on Sundays
was used as a church; a milliner&rsquo;s shop, a blacksmith&rsquo;s
forge, and two or three stores. Butcher and baker were
unknown, there was no beef or mutton to sell, and no roads
for carts to travel along had there been.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The climate was genial and the situation
beautiful, and the Bishop hoped that Auckland
might be the future cathedral city. For the
moment, however, it seemed best that he should
settle at the Waimate on the Bay of Islands.
It had been the first headquarters of the C.M.S.
mission and the Bishop went to inspect it
immediately on his arrival in New Zealand.
He described it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I walked round the mission station and inspected Mr.
Clarke&rsquo;s house, which I decided would accommodate Sarah
and such of the party as I might leave with her. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
house is a little out of repair.... The garden has been
overrun with cattle, but most of the plants are still alive,
and with a little care may soon recover.... Seen from
a distance the Waimate presents the appearance of an
English village with a white church and spire, comfortable
houses and gardens. This is by far the most settled place
in the country. I am informed that four hundred native
communicants assemble at the Lord&rsquo;s Table. This will
probably be my headquarters for some years, till I can
deliberately choose a site for my residence and erect
substantial buildings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the moment Mrs. Selwyn was to stay
with the Williams, whilst the Bishop went off
on a journey to visit the other mission stations.
He was very pleased with what he saw of the
missionaries and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be very zealous and able ministers, and I
think myself happy in having under me a body in whom I
shall see so much to commend and so little to reprove.
The state of the mission is really wonderfully good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year&rsquo;s experience satisfied him that he had
been right in the choice of the Waimate for his
residence and for his college. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every day convinces me more and more that we are
better placed here than in one of the English towns. The
general laxity of morals, and defect of Church principles
in the new settlements, would make them dangerous
places for the education of the young, and render it almost
impossible to keep up that high tone of religious character
and strictness of discipline which is required, both as a
protest against the prevailing order of things, and as a
training for our candidates for Holy Orders. At the
Waimate, I am fettered by no usages, subject to no fashions,
influenced by no expectations of other men. I can take
the course which seems to me best.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Already before leaving England, he had
thought out how to make the Church in
New Zealand independent of home support as
soon as possible. With this purpose he asked the
S.P.G. to allow him to use what money they
could grant him not in paying salaries to the
clergy, but in buying sites for future churches,
and lands which might provide for some endowments.
He wished in the plans he made to
avoid both the evils in connexion with endowments
which he had seen at home and the
dependence on annual grants. He proposed to
have a general endowment fund so as to avoid
inequalities of endowment, and he determined
to allow of no private patronage. Into this
general endowment fund he urged all those who
received stipends from England, through the
Societies or otherwise, to pay what they received,
as he himself did. In time he set up in every
settlement an archdeaconry church fund into
which all money collected or given to the Church
was to be paid, and out of which each minister
was to receive his stipend. Deacons were to
begin with &pound;100, rising gradually to &pound;300 as
priests, archdeacons &pound;400, and bishops &pound;500 as
soon as they should be appointed. In each case,
if possible, a house was to be provided, though
it was not guaranteed. In all his plans from
the first, he aimed at keeping the Church completely
independent of State control. He preferred
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
as he said, &ldquo;to maintain the Church&rsquo;s
independence, and to commit her support to
the free charities of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These plans, thought out before he left
England, he set himself to carry out as opportunity
arose. He proceeded at once to buy
suitable land for the Church. But whilst his
fertile brain was thus full of plans for the future,
he was equally keen to study the conditions of
the present, and before even unpacking his
books, he started on a journey to visit all the
mission stations in the Northern Island. One
of the first places which he stopped at was
Wellington, which he reached by a small trading
vessel. Here he spent three weeks, much
occupied in nursing a young man who had come
out with him from England, and from whom he
had hoped much as a fellow worker. In this he
showed his ability to turn his hand to anything
and his tenderness as a nurse. One who watched
him wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He practised every little art that nourishment might be
supplied to his patient. He pounded chicken into fine
powder; he made jellies, he listened to every sound; he
sat up the whole night through by the bed-side. In short
he did everything worthy of his noble nature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His care unfortunately was in vain and
to his great sorrow the young man died.
Chief Justice Martin, who was going to accompany
him for part of his visitation, arrived
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
to find the Bishop pale and worn with his long
nursing. The two friends then started on their
journey. Most of it had to be made on foot,
often wading through rivers. Sometimes it
was possible to ride on horse back, sometimes
to go in a canoe on the rivers. Both Bishop
and Judge made light of any hardships they
might meet. The beauty of the country was a
constant delight, and it was a great joy to the
Bishop to find the large and devout congregations
of Maoris which gathered at the mission
stations on Sundays. Where there were
English settlers a service for them followed the
native service. The Bishop writes: &ldquo;I never
felt the full blessing of the Lord&rsquo;s day as a day
of rest more than in New Zealand.&rdquo; Everywhere
they were warmly welcomed, alike by
missionaries and natives, and the Bishop was
much pleased with all that he saw. Of one
evening he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The natives assembled in considerable numbers for
evening service and scripture questions. After I had
questioned them as much as I thought fit, I invited them
to ask me their difficulties; upon which such a series of
scriptural questions was asked that our meeting did not
break up till ten at night, and then only because I explained
that my party were tired and wanted to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On another occasion he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The natives, on seeing us, sent canoes to bring us to the
island, where we were received with all ceremony, welcomed
with speeches, and presented with ducks, potatoes and
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
lake shell fish. I made my return as usual in Gospels of
St. Matthew.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the stations were ministered to only
by native catechists and on one occasion, he was
much struck by the venerable figure and manner
of a fine old blind man catechising his class.
It seemed as if the Christian teaching of the
missionaries was already spread throughout the
whole land; little churches and schools were to
be found in many places, the fields around the
stations were well cultivated, industries were
being introduced; the Maoris, a race famous
for their ferocity, were learning to live quietly
and peacefully. The Bishop writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is much to encourage me: vast numbers can now
read and write well and when I have lectures of an evening,
it amuses me to see the means they resort to, climbing
up on stands inside the building, and many come half an
hour before the bell rings, so anxious are they to hear the
word of God explained. Some travel ten miles on the
Saturday for the services of the next day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most interesting stations visited
was that at Waikanoe, where the experienced
missionary, Rev. O. Hadfield, was in charge.
From there the Bishop wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You would be surprised at the comparative comfort
which I enjoy in my encampments. My tent is strewn with
dry fern and grass. My air-bed is laid upon it. My
books, clothes and other goods lie beside it; and though
the whole dimensions of my dwelling do not exceed eight
feet by five, I have more room than I require and am as
comfortable as it is possible for a man to be when he is
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
absent from those he loves most. I spent October 17th,
the anniversary of my consecration, in my tent on the
sandhills, with no companion but three natives.... I
was led naturally to contrast my present position with the
very different scenes at Fulham and Lambeth last year.
I can assure you that the comparison brought with it no
feelings of discontent; on the contrary, I spent the greater
part of the day, after the usual services and readings with
my natives, in thinking with gratitude over the many
mercies and blessings granted to me in the past year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a night spent in Mr. Hadfield&rsquo;s house,
service was held in the chapel: &ldquo;more than
500 had come from various parts, so that the
chapel and the space outside the walls was quite
full.&rdquo; Later on during this journey, he was
met by William Williams, whom he had decided
to appoint Archdeacon of Waiapu, so that he
might have the oversight of the eastern half of
the Island. All that he had seen had strengthened
his conviction of the need that from the
first the Church should be organized on a firm
basis, and as he could not be everywhere and
oversee everything himself, he wished to have
the help of archdeacons working under him.
In spite of the large congregations of natives,
he wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This people is a very wicked people, and if &lsquo;civilized&rsquo;
without the influence of the Gospel upon it, they will not
be benefited in any way. The influence of the immoral
English living in the land is the greatest difficulty I have
to contend with.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Ahuriri he found &ldquo;a very numerous Christian
community though they had only once been
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
visited by a missionary. The chapel was a
substantial building capable of containing four
hundred people. In the evening our canoe
having stuck fast, we were left without tents or
food till midnight; we then procured one tent,
in which the first Chief Justice, the first Bishop
and the first Archdeacon of New Zealand
huddled in their blankets for the night. Surely
such an aggregate of legal and clerical dignity
was never before collected under one piece of
canvas.&rdquo; He describes a Sunday on their tour
a few day&rsquo;s later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The morning opened as usual with the morning hymn of
the birds, which Captain Cook compared to a concert of
silver bells. When this ceased at sunrise, the sound of
native voices chanting around our tents carried on the same
tribute of praise and thanksgiving, while audible murmurs
brought to our ears the passages of the Bible which they
were reading.... I cannot convey to you the least idea
of the train of innumerable thoughts which are suggested
continually both by the beauty of the scenery, the character
of the natives, the various plants, insects and birds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next Sunday there gathered on Poverty Bay
&ldquo;a noble congregation of at least a thousand,
assembled amid the ruins of their chapel, which
had been blown down.... After morning
service the natives formed into classes for
reading and saying the catechism&mdash;old tattoed
and boys, and submitting to lose their places
for every mistake with perfect good humour.&rdquo;
The Bishop&rsquo;s tour took him right across the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
centre of the island, where he walked over hills
covered with fern trees, and sometimes enjoyed
the rest of being paddled along a beautiful river.
At one station that he visited he met the
missionary, Rev. R. Maunsell, said to be one
of the best linguists on the mission, and after
consultation with him formed a &ldquo;translation
committee, composed of two clergymen and two
catechists, from which he hoped in due time to
get a standard copy of both Bible and Prayer-book
to be published under authority.&rdquo; The Chief
Justice had left him to return to Auckland by
sea, and on January 3rd, the Bishop also turned
in the direction of Auckland and thus describes
the last bit of his journey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My last pair of thick shoes being worn out, and my feet
much blistered by walking on the stumps, I borrowed a
horse from the native teacher and started at 4 a.m. to go
twelve miles to Mr. Hamlin&rsquo;s mission station on Manakan
harbour. Then ten miles by boat across the harbour.
After a beautiful run of two hours, I landed with my faithful
Maori, Rota, who had steadily accompanied me all the way,
carrying my bag with gown and cassock, the only articles
in my possession which would have fetched sixpence in the
Auckland rag market. The suit which I wore was kept
sufficiently decent, by much care, to enable me to enter
Auckland by daylight; and my last remaining pair of
shoes (thin ones) were strong enough for the light and sandy
walk of six miles. At two p.m. I reached the Judge&rsquo;s
house by a path avoiding the town, and passing over land
which I have bought for the site of the cathedral; a spot
which I hope may hereafter be traversed by the feet of
many bishops, better shod and far less ragged than myself.
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
It is a noble site overlooking the whole town and with a
sea-view stretching out over the numerous islands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this journey of six months, the Bishop
had travelled 2,277 miles, of which he had
walked 762. His chief object had been to learn
to know the country and its needs, so that he
might plan his future work wisely. He notes
with satisfaction that on this journey he met
Mr. Williams on the exact day which he had
appointed more than a month before, showing
how, even in travelling through wild country,
it was possible to be punctual.</p>
<p>When Selwyn got back to the Waimate,
having learned much about the country, his
first care was the College. He had hoped that
his friend, Mr. Whytehead, who had come out
with him from England would be its head.
But to his deep sorrow, he heard that Mr.
Whytehead had been taken ill at Sydney, and
died three months after reaching the Waimate,
leaving the memory of a saintly character to
inspire those who should work after him.</p>
<p>The chief object of the College was to train
clergy. Besides the College there was a boarding
school, where Selwyn&rsquo;s plan was to educate Maori
lads and the sons of settlers together. He had
most carefully thought out the principles upon
which both college and school were to be
founded. He believed that it was perfectly
possible to civilize the whole rising generation
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
of New Zealanders; the one impediment was the
difficulty of getting enough English teachers, for
not only must education be provided, but also
instruction in the &ldquo;most minute details of daily
life and in every useful and industrious habit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We are apt,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;to forget the laborious
procession by which we acquired in early
life the routine duties of cleanliness, order,
method and punctuality.&rdquo; Men were needed
to train the scholars who had no sense of their
own dignity and thought nothing beneath it,
&ldquo;who will go into the lowest and darkest corner
of the native character to see where the difficulty
lies which keeps them from being assimilated
to ourselves. They have received the Gospel
freely, and with an unquestioning faith, but the
unfavourable tendency of native habits is every
day dragging back many into the state of sin
from which they seemed to have escaped....
We require men who will number every hair of a
native&rsquo;s head, as part of the work of Him who
made and redeemed the world.&rdquo; He found
that the bane of the native people was desultory
work interrupted by total idleness, and their
inclination to waste their occasional earnings
on useless horses or cast-off dress clothes. He
feared lest the sons of the settlers should grow
up with a sense of superiority and look upon
honest labour as disreputable, because of the
class of servile natives who clustered round the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
towns. So he desired &ldquo;to raise the character
of both races by humbling them&rdquo; and teaching
them the dignity of labour. All the students
were to spend part of their time in some useful
occupation for the support of the institutions.
There were industrial classes, where printing,
carpentry, carving and weaving were taught.
Selwyn considered printing, of all trades, the
best fitted morally and mechanically to train
&ldquo;the wayward and careless disposition of an
uncivilized youth,&rdquo; since, &ldquo;to print at all,
he must work orderly.&rdquo; The youngest boys
were to work in the garden, the elder ones to
learn farming and forestry.</p>
<p>In the College, though the students were
to take their part in the manual labours, he
wished to preserve an academic atmosphere,
and the students wore caps and gowns, at any
rate on special occasions. Its chief purpose was
to train the clergy of the future, as he could not
hope to obtain a sufficient supply from England.
He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We must go to all orders of colonists and to the native
people without respect of persons, and select from among
their children the future candidates for Holy Orders.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But since it was impossible to be sure that those
so chosen would grow up fitted for the ministerial
vocation, no pledges were asked of them, and
the opportunities of secular training provided
fitted the youth to enter upon other lines of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
life, should it appear when the right time came
that he was not fitted for the special studies
needed for Holy Orders. He expected that
strangers would hardly be able to understand
the complex character of the Institution, but he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is an open and undisguised reality about our work,
which seems to be highly favourable to the discrimination
of character, and therefore to the due selection of instruments:
a class of demure students with face and tone of
voice and manner conformed to the standard which they
believe to be expected, would be a poor exchange for a
healthful and mirthful company of youths, as yet unconstrained
by pledges and professions, who show their true
character in every act of their lives whether of business or
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The only real endowment for St. John&rsquo;s College is the
industry and self-denial of all its members. Even if
industry were not in itself honourable, the purposes of the
institution would be enough to hallow every useful art and
manual labour by which its resources might be augmented.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the members of the mission shared in the
manual work, and all, including Mrs. Selwyn,
dined together with the students in the Hall.
She was much beloved by the natives; they
called her Mother Bishop, and described her as
&ldquo;having great grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Keri-keri, a few miles from Paihai, what
was to be the Cathedral library was set up, in
the one stone house on the island, which had
been used as a store for mission supplies. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
library was a very real joy to the Bishop, he
speaks of a day in it as &ldquo;a day of literary
luxury&rdquo; when he sat &ldquo;looking upon the books,
occasionally dipping into them. The very sight
of so many venerable folios is most refreshing
in this land where everything is so new&rdquo;;
and again &ldquo;as a charming retreat for his wife
when over-wearied with her many and varied
duties.... The quiet is as unbroken as the
most nervous person could desire, and in this
respect entirely different from the inevitable
noise of wooden buildings. Here also I may
retire in my old age, which will probably be
premature, and superintend my College at the
Waimate without being subject to all its
perturbations.... The charm of this library
is that it is so utterly uncolonial. Its walls
are worthy of a college. My books carry me
back to the first ages of the Church. It is true
that when I step outside the door I stumble
over a mass of utilitarian treasures. Bales of
blankets, iron pots, barrels of all kinds are the
miscellaneous furniture of my ante-chambers;
but within, everything that can most elevate
and purify the mind is to be found. Leisure
alone is at present wanting for us to use our
treasures; but as the Church system is developed,
and active archdeacons stationed at
all the principal settlements, I hope to be able
to give myself more to meditation and every
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
other profitable exercise, that there may be
some abundance in my own heart to flow forth
for the benefit of my diocese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Material things which might conduce to the
well-being of his people were not forgotten by
the Bishop. There were then already sheep
in New Zealand, but he found that &ldquo;the
Maoris did not know how &lsquo;to transfer the fleece
from the back of the sheep to that of the man.&rsquo;&rdquo;
He was distressed to see precious wool buried
in the ground because the natives did not know
how to use it, and wrote to a friend in Wales
to ask about spinning machines suitable for the
manufacture of coarse cloth in his native school,
and for a supply of knitting pins for the children.</p>
<p>As was natural there were many interruptions
to peaceful progress. News of a conflict between
Maoris and settlers at Wairan near
Nelson which lead to the massacre of twenty-three
settlers, gave the Bishop &ldquo;the gloomiest
day he had yet spent in New Zealand.&rdquo; This
conflict arose as usual over a dispute about land,
from misunderstanding of native customs, and
from the little knowledge on the part of the
settlers of the native language and character.
Selwyn was afraid lest news of it should give
a bad impression of the natives. He himself
was convinced of the absolute safety of free
intercourse with them and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have no fastenings to our windows, even on the ground
floor, and the door is rarely locked. In travelling I pitch
my tent at whatever place I happen to reach at nightfall,
and am always hospitably received. In the course of
some hundred miles of travelling I have never lost anything.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1844, the Bishop made a second long
visitation of his diocese, and for the first time
visited the southern island, then much more
sparcely inhabited than the northern. It was
not easy to get about on land; many rivers
had to be forded and one of the party could not
swim, so the Bishop&rsquo;s air-bed had to be converted
into a raft in order to convey him across the
rivers. In one part of the island the Bishop
was much troubled to find religious dissensions
amongst the natives, some of whom had been
taught by a Wesleyan missionary. He wrote
sadly, &ldquo;controversy has preceded truth, and as
usual darkened true knowledge.&rdquo; As his later
policy showed, had he found a really strong
Wesleyan mission established, he would not
have attempted to interfere; but he found that
the mission had only been roused into some sort
of activity when other teachers had appeared
on the field. He could not recognize that the
mere fact of the residence of one missionary,
entitled that one to claim the spiritual care of all
the southern islands. Neither would he countenance
intercommunion between Wesleyans
and Anglicans as had been the custom in
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
some parts before his coming. But his personal
intercourse with the Wesleyan missionary was
most friendly. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed one day and a half in his house; but I told him
that I could make no transfer of catechumens; that we
must hold our own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He saw need for vigorous work in the south
amongst the half-caste population, &ldquo;where the
fathers and mothers have been living together
for some years, I married them and baptized
their children: in all twenty-five couples
married and sixty-one children baptized. I
must have a visiting clergyman in the Straits
as soon as possible, but where to find a man fit
for the work I know not.... Many of the old
whalers and sealers are settling down into a
more quiet life, and are to a man anxious that
their children should not follow the course of
life which they have led themselves.&rdquo; The
problems he met with on this visitation made
him think much of his future plans for the
diocese, seeking guidance in framing them from
the first three centuries of the Church&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Amongst the Bishop&rsquo;s difficulties were his
relations with the Church Missionary Society.
Whilst full of admiration for the work of their
missionaries, he would not ordain the laymen
among them except on the condition that he
decided the sphere of their work. As the
Society refused to accept this condition, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Bishop would not ordain the catechists in their
missions. He also refused to ordain any as
priests who had not attained a certain standard
of learning, and he waited to ordain any native
till he considered him sufficiently educated.
In all these matters, the Society had a different
policy. They were accustomed to control
their own missions from home and were not
inclined to give way to a Bishop who had only
come out after the missions had been well
established. These and other difficulties and
misunderstandings led to the refusal of the
Society to rent permanently to the Bishop the
wooden buildings at the Waimate, where he had
set up his College.</p>
<p>As he could not stay at the Waimate Selwyn
determined to move at once to Auckland which
he had always intended to be the Episcopal See.
When the Maoris in the Waimate district
heard of his intended removal, there was much
disturbance. Lady Martin describes the scene
that followed. It was on what was called
market day, when the Maoris brought their
wares for sale, and before the traffic began
there was school and cathechising in the chapel
after morning prayers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The people had heard a rumour of the Bishop&rsquo;s intention
to remove to Auckland, and there was a great deal of
speech-making on the subject. A powerful speaker opened
the debate. The orator began by trotting slowly up and
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
down a given space, always beginning and ending each
sentence with his run to and fro. After a while he got
warmed up and excited, and then he rushed backwards
and forwards, he leaped up off the ground, he slapped his
thigh, shouted, waved his spear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed more as if he were breathing out
death and destruction than as if he were urging
the Bishop to stay among his people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was very amusing to see the two brothers Williams
stand up and answer them. Archdeacon Henry Williams,
a stout, old-fashioned looking clergyman with broad-brimmed
hat and spectacles, marched up and down with a
spear in his hand, and elicited shouts of applause. Then
his brother drew a large space on the gravel, and divided
it into three parts, and asked whether it was not fair that
the Bishop should live in the middle of the diocese instead
of at either end. There was a loud murmur of voices,
&lsquo;It is just,&rsquo; but all the same they did not like to lose him
and his large party from among them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month later, the Bishop, with his family
and friends, started for Auckland. Mrs. Selwyn
and their little boy rode, the Bishop walked,
carrying his infant son swathed in a plaid to
his side. As they left the Waimate, crowds
gathered to bid them farewell. At Auckland
the large party, together with the native students,
had to live in tents till the college buildings
were ready for them.</p>
<p>In order that there might be someone to
superintend the Church in the Waimate district,
Selwyn appointed Henry Williams to be Archdeacon
of the Waimate, saying in his letter
to him, &ldquo;your long experience, and your great
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
influence with the natives, will give me the
greatest confidence in delegating to you the
charge of this portion of my diocese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September, 1844, as a further step to that
complete organization which he contemplated,
the Bishop summoned a Synod of his clergy.
Three Archdeacons, four other priests and two
deacons met together with him, in order &ldquo;to
frame rules for the better management of the
mission and the general government of the
Church.&rdquo; On this occasion they discussed only
questions of church discipline and extension,
but it was the beginning of that complete
system of self-government which was to establish
the independence of the Church in New
Zealand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">THE MAORIS AND THE SETTLERS</span></h2>
<p>The Maori chiefs regarded the treaty of Waitangi
as the Charter of their liberties, and in the
opinion of Bishop Selwyn it was &ldquo;highly
beneficial to the people of New Zealand since
it gave them the protection of the British
Government and assured them &lsquo;that no land
would be taken from them which they were
not willing to sell.&rsquo;&rdquo; But the treaty was
obnoxious to the members of the New Zealand
Company, since it was a continual hindrance to
their plans for the development of the Colony.
They were constantly arousing the suspicions
of the Maoris by their efforts to evade it. The
conditions of the country were rapidly changing
and as yet the new order had not been firmly
established. On the one side were the fears
and suspicions of the Maoris that they had been
betrayed and would lose their lands, suspicions
encouraged by those white adventurers who
disliked the idea of a settled government. On
the other side was what Selwyn described as
&ldquo;the discontented and insubordinate temper of
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
our own settlers.&rdquo; He writes of the situation
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The one general imputation against all of us was a concealed
intention of dispossessing the natives of their land,
and reducing them to slavery. In support of this, the acts
of our countrymen in other lands were related to them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The missionaries made constant efforts for
peace and assured the natives that the British
Government was determined to protect their
rights and property. Great was their surprise
and consternation when a Report of the House
of Commons stated that &ldquo;all lands not
actually occupied by the natives are declared to
be vested in the Crown.&rdquo; Selwyn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The natives of New Zealand cannot bear this uncertainty;
they can see the merits of a question as clearly as we can;
but if they detect us in a falsehood, or even in a change of
purpose the reason of which they cannot understand, our
influence with them is lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in the neighbourhood of the Bay of
Islands that there was most restlessness, and
here the discontented Maoris gathered round a
chief named John Heke. On a hill overlooking
the village of Kororareke there was a blockhouse
with a few soldiers and a flagstaff on which the
British flag was flying. This was to the natives
a symbol of British sovereignty. Heke was a
Christian and had no hostility to the missionaries,
nor did he desire to destroy the property
of the settlers. It was the fear lest his people
should be reduced to the condition of slaves that
aroused his hostility. The Bishop writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meetings began to be held at which John Heke was the
chief speaker, the subject of discussion being the cutting
down of the flagstaff. In the month of August, 1844,
Heke assembled a party of armed men, and proceeded to
Kororareke, where he spent Saturday and part of Sunday
in alarming the natives and early on Monday morning,
mounted the hill and cut down the flagstaff. I was at
Paihai at the time, engaged in the native school, at the
close of which the first words I heard were &lsquo;the colour has
fallen.&rsquo; I shuddered at the thought of this beginning of
hostilities, so full of presage of evil for the future. Heke
then crossed to Paihai, and with his party danced the war
dance in my face, after which many violent speeches were
made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s fears were justified; a troubled
period of anarchy followed. Soldiers were sent
for from Sydney to defend the settlers and their
property. The fighting was most serious in
the district round Kororareke. During the
next two years the flagstaff was cut down on
three more occasions, and the town of Kororareke
was captured by the Maori rebels. The Bishop
watched the attack from his little sailing vessel,
to which he had brought some of the wives and
children of the settlers for safety. Then he
landed with Mr. Williams to recover and bury
the bodies of the dead. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We found the town in the possession of the natives,
who were busily engaged in plundering the houses. Their
behaviour to us was perfectly civil and inoffensive. Several
immediately guided us to the spots where the bodies were
down upon this day of sorrow.... The state of the town
after the withdrawal of the troops was very characteristic.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
The natives carried on their work of plunder with perfect
composure, neither quarrelling among themselves nor
resenting any attempt on the part of the English to recover
portions of their property.... With sorrow I observed
that many of the natives were wheeling off casks of spirits;
but they listened patiently to my remonstrances, and in one
instance they allowed me to turn the cock and let the liquor
run out upon the ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That evening he rode to the Waimate and from
there watched the burning of Kororareke, the
whole sky lighted up by the blaze of burning
houses. The next morning passing near the
scene of desolation to get to his boat, he noticed
how &ldquo;all that had been devoted to mammon
was gone, but heathen vengeance had spared
the patrimony of God. The two chapels and
the houses of the clergy remained undestroyed.&rdquo;
It was impossible to say what would be the
result of this native success upon the &ldquo;position
and prospects&rdquo; of the Christian teachers. But
there were some hopeful signs, and the Bishop
was clear as to the part he intended to play.
&ldquo;My hope is that by cautious and judicious
management, the Church interest in this country
may be kept clear of all political dissensions.
On one point I think that I may speak decisively,
that there is no evidence of any general or
indiscriminate hatred of the natives towards
the English settlers, or any disposition to bloodthirsty
or savage acts of violence. The proceedings
at Kororareke were conducted with
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
all the usages of European warfare.... In
the midst of much that was fearful, there was
much also that proved the indirect effect of
religion and civilization upon the minds of the
natives.... There are many signs which give
us great hopes for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop exerted himself on every possible
occasion to promote peace and to save life,
exposing himself fearlessly in his efforts to
bring off safely the wives and children of the
settlers, who were conveyed to Auckland and
there cared for by Mrs. Selwyn and the other
ladies. But his absolute neutrality was not
appreciated and he was called a traitor because
he would not share in the general hatred of the
natives. He did not allow his unpopularity to
disturb him and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The real subject of grief is the injury which is done to
religion by the un-Christian feelings and language which
many permit and justify in themselves. In this perversion
of public feeling it becomes necessary to stand firm and let
the flood sweep by.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But his courage and devotion were amply
recognized by those who witnessed it. The
officer commanding the <i>Hazard</i>, the British
vessel which had brought the troops from Sydney
to the ill-fated encounter with the natives,
wrote to him saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a single man on board who does not appreciate
your conduct.... Go where you will, you will carry
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
with you the good wishes of all who saw you under the
late trying circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disturbances had begun whilst the Bishop
was on a confirmation tour. At one place he had
confirmed 300 natives, and there were numbers
of Christian natives quite ready to fight for
him should he desire it. Now that there was a
general fear lest the unrest caused by the rising
of Heke should spread and endanger the settlements
further south, the Bishop was anxious
to visit them and do all he could to promote
peace. On this journey he took Mrs. Selwyn
with him. She helped in the work of spreading
confidence by her ministrations to the sick.
She felt no fear of any possible unfriendliness on
the part of the natives, for as she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you live among them, you find them looking up to you
and clinging to you in all points, and the fear ceases.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To her great delight she was taken on a little
bush expedition, as she longed to see with her
own eyes how so large a part of the Bishop&rsquo;s
life was spent. During these next years he
carried on the work of ministering to his people
and administering his diocese in the midst of
continual anxiety caused by the Maori unrest,
consequent on the efforts of the New Zealand
Company to get possession of the native lands.</p>
<p>The failure of the Governor, Captain Fitzroy,
to restore order led to his removal, and Sir
George Grey, a young and able administrator,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
was sent from South Australia to take his place.
Under his energetic measures conditions were
improving, when news came from England that
the pressure brought to bear upon the Colonial
Office by the New Zealand Company, had led to
an Act being passed through Parliament (1846)
which set aside the Treaty of Waitangi and
annulled its provisions. Against this both
Judge Martin and Bishop Selwyn protested in
no measured terms. They considered it a
breach of faith, destructive of the honour of
England and certain to put an end to all hope
of peaceful relations with the Maoris. The
strength of the Bishop&rsquo;s feelings is shown in a
letter to a friend in which he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather that he (Earl Grey, the Colonial Secretary)
cut me in pieces than induced me, by any personal compliments,
to resign the New Zealanders to the tender
mercies of men, who avow the right to take the land of the
New Zealanders, and who would not scruple to use force
for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s protest led to his being spoken of
in the House of Commons by the radical member,
Joseph Hume, as &ldquo;a turbulent priest.&rdquo; Sir George
Grey realized at once the impossibility of
carrying out the instructions sent by the Colonial
Office. He professed to believe that they were
not meant to be carried out literally, and his
representations led the English Government to
agree to suspend the execution of the Act
passed by Parliament for five years, during
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
which time Sir George Grey devoted himself to
framing a new constitution for the colony.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the difficulties of the land
question disturbed the relations of the Bishop
with one of the most experienced and revered
missionaries in the country, Henry Williams,
whom he had made Archdeacon of Waimate.
Williams, in order to make provision for his
family, had bought land from the natives on
which he had settled his sons, who cultivated
it with great success. His claim to these lands
was approved by the Council set up in 1844
by Governor Fitzroy to consider the whole
question of land claims. In recommending the
awards made to Henry Williams the Governor
said, &ldquo;that there could be no doubt that Mr.
Williams had done more for the advancement
and improvement of the aboriginal race than
any other individual member of the missionary
body.&rdquo; But the missionaries by their defence
of the rights of the natives were extremely
unpopular with the New Zealand Company,
and the good condition of the lands held by
the Williams family, owing to their excellent
farming, excited the jealousy of the incoming
colonists. The new Governor, Sir George Grey,
saw that questions of land tenure were the
chief cause of all the troubles with the natives.
In his early days, when only insufficiently
acquainted with conditions in New Zealand, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
was much too ready to believe the accusations
made by the Company against the missionaries
of having used their position to acquire unlawfully
large tracts of lands from the natives.
He wrote home to the Colonial Office a private
dispatch condemning in strong language the
land purchases of the missionaries. Bishop
Selwyn, who on other occasions had vigorously
defended the missionaries against the Company,
did not on principle approve of missionaries
owning land for themselves. He wished that
their sons should be trained for the service of
the Church, and he appealed to the missionaries
to teach their children &ldquo;to renounce the barren
pride of ownership for the moral husbandry of
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom in the harvest of souls.&rdquo; In his
zeal and eagerness he seems to have forgotten that
all young men are not fitted to be missionaries
or teachers. To him it was a plain issue; he did
not sufficiently understand Williams&rsquo; position.
To Williams it appeared that the Bishop was
in alliance with the Governor against him, and
he felt bitterly the seeming desertion of the man
whom he had admired so warmly. When urged
by the Bishop to give up the title deeds to his
lands he refused. Strong in the consciousness of
his own uprightness, he would consent to no
compromise by which it might have seemed that
he felt himself to be in the wrong. It was not
his property that he was defending, but his
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
character, which had been impugned by the
charges made against his conduct by the
Governor to the Home Government. The whole
matter was of course brought before the Church
Missionary Society at home. They were
plunged into great perplexity. They did not
feel themselves strong enough to oppose the
authorities both at home and in New Zealand,
and they did not really thoroughly know the
facts. They decided at last that the wisest
course to pursue was to dismiss Henry Williams
from their service. He made no further attempt
to defend himself, but, deeply hurt at the
treatment he had received after his long and
devoted service, he left his home at Paihai and
retired to his sons&rsquo; farm at Pakaraka, amidst
the loud regrets of the people amongst whom
he had lived and worked for twenty-seven
years, and amongst whom he had hoped to die.
He had defended himself warmly, with all the
impetuosity of his nature, for he had felt himself
to be a man cruelly caluminated. Now he
would say no more. He continued to work
amongst the Maoris in his neighbourhood, and a
church was built for him by his sons in which he
ministered. Meanwhile his brother went to
England and explained the case fully to the
C.M.S. In 1854 when Bishop Selwyn and Sir
George Grey were both in England, they too,
having no doubt arrived at a fuller understanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
of the matter, visited the C.M.S., and
the Bishop expressed his wish that Williams
should be reinstated, which was done.</p>
<p>The complexity and importance of the land
question in New Zealand is shown by this painful
controversy, in which men of the high character
of Bishop Selwyn and Sir George Grey were led,
in their zeal for order and for the rights of the
Maoris, to condemn, on insufficient knowledge
a man of the character and devotion of Henry
Williams. He himself no doubt added to the
difficulty by his impetuous character and his
caustic way of expressing himself, but on the
question in dispute itself, not a shadow of blame
can be attached to him. Selwyn seems to have
judged over hastily, and to have shown incapacity
to see all sides of the question, in his desire that
the missionaries should show themselves superior
to all worldly considerations. Henry Williams
believed that the Bishop was led away by his
love of power, and that he was unable to give
way when he first discovered that he had made
a mistake. In later years friendly relations
between him and the Williams family were
fully resumed. How much he valued and
appreciated the family, is shown by the fact that
William Williams was amongst the first of the
men he recommended to fill one of the new
sees formed when his diocese was divided.</p>
<p>These three men, Selwyn, Grey and Williams,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
were all equally anxious to uphold justice and
the best interests of the Maoris, though they
differed so seriously on this occasion. Selwyn&rsquo;s
attitude towards the Maoris made him most
unpopular for a time amongst the settlers.
His constant effort was to promote peace and to
ensure prosperity and justice for all, but long
afterwards, he would recall how his arrival
used to be greeted by the settlers with &ldquo;Here
comes the Bishop to prevent us fighting with the
natives.&rdquo; One day when he was landing in a
small boat from his schooner at Wellington, he
heard a man asking his companion: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that schooner that has come in this evening?&rdquo;
and the reply was, &ldquo;Oh, that old fool the
Bishop&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Jumping on shore at that moment
he called out, chuckling and rubbing his hands,
&ldquo;Yes, and here&rsquo;s the old fool himself.&rdquo; He
went on his way careless of popularity and
heedless of the criticism inevitable in the case
of a man of such vigour and so many activities.</p>
<p>He found relief from his many anxieties in
the work connected with his college and
schools at Auckland. These were beautifully
situated about five miles outside the town.
Gifts from England enabled him to erect solid
stone buildings, a hospital as well as the schools;
each year there was some improvement. There
were playing fields where the Maori boys could
play cricket, pastures for cattle and sheep, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
well as gardens, fields, a printing press, weaving
and carpentering sheds. In 1846 there were
already one hundred and thirty persons, English
and Maori, connected with the College. All
alike shared in the cultivation of the estate and
lived together as one family. The Bishop
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have given up house-keeping and have brought all my
income to bear on the College.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Selwyn shared his work in every way in
her power. She taught in the girls&rsquo; school and
nursed in the hospital. In Judge Martin and
his wife they had friends who sympathized with
all their plans and gave them much personal
help.</p>
<p>When visiting the mission stations round the
coast in his little sailing vessel, the Bishop was
always on the look out for new scholars. He
wrote to a friend whilst on one of these voyages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Can you conceive a more interesting employment than
hunting in this wild country for hopeful plants to stock my
nursery at Auckland. One of my main employments during
this journey has been to collect the children of the native
settlements and examine them; and where I found anyone
who especially pleased me, to invite his father to bring him
up to my school. In no case have I met with a refusal....
I have no doubt that I can have as many as we can
afford to maintain from all parts of the island. My Eton
experience I hope will be of use to me in this search, for
nothing used to interest me more than to form opinions
of the character of the boys from their physiognomy, and
then watch their progress through the school. I think
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
that I have heard you say as a dahlia fancier that Brown,
of Slough, is in the habit of growing thousands of seedlings
in the hope of raising one rare and valuable flower; and so
people, in the hope of rearing some few who may hereafter
be admitted to the ministry. That they have intellectual
powers of a high order I have no doubt; what they want
is an entire correction of habits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Maoris had learned confidence in him, and
men, old, prejudiced and bloodstained had come
to desire a better training for their children.
He had well advanced plans for a second College
in the Southern Island, but this he was not
able to establish owing to the pressure of other
calls.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s desire was to educate the sons
of the settlers and the Maoris together, and this
was done at first. He wrote in 1849:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I must be a tyrant, and to be a good natured tyrant is the
difficulty. The explosive element in all countries having
a mixed population, is the disposition of the one to domineer
over the other. We are succeeding at last, I hope in
amalgamating the two races in an equality of privileges
and position; but it is uphill work; it seemed so natural
to every English boy and man to have a Maori for his fag.
I think that by God&rsquo;s blessing we shall succeed at last, and
if we do it will be a glorious measure of success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This growing work made the Bishop anxiously
eager for more helpers. He wrote urgently to
Mr. Abraham who had promised to leave Eton
and join him as soon as he could. The work he
saw before him was too great for one man.
He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;To move my diocese in any perceptible degree, I must
multiply my own single force through a multitude of wheels
and powers; alone I am powerless. Before me lies an
inert mass which I am utterly unable to heave; and there
is no engine ready by which I can supply the defects of my
own weakness. I am bewildered by the multitude of
details, and sometimes doubt whether I am right in complicating
the episcopate with all the machinery of the
subordinate ministries; and yet I feel that without that
pervading influence, the whole system will be powerless.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words show what the organization of his
diocese meant to him. He was planting a free
and independent Church which was to endure,
not doing a piece of individual mission work.
Cherishing these wide plans for the future, he
wanted helpers who could take his place when
he had to be absent on his visitation journeys.
&ldquo;I have scarcely a person in the place,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;who has any eye for minute and careful
arrangement, without which no barbarous
people, I am sure, can ever be thoroughly
Christianised. Throughout the whole mission the
delusion has prevailed more or less, that the
Gospel will give habits as well as teach principles.
My conviction is that habits uncorrected will
be the thorns which will choke the good seed ...
to get that personal and parental care bestowed
upon the native children which will qualify
them to be hereafter Christian parents in every
sense, is the difficulty which almost weighs me
to the ground.&rdquo; The smaller cares and the
great visions of the future all had their place in
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
his mind, but he could not help fearing what
might be the effect on an over-detailed mind of
the increasing serving of tables. He felt that
he specially needed the help of his friend when
&ldquo;the very causes which most require earnestness
in prayer made him unable to pray as he ought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expect nothing from us,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but
bring with you as large a spiritual treasure as
you can. Come to help rather than to be
helped.&rdquo; Two years later in 1849, when he at
last heard that Mr. Abraham was able to come,
he wrote to his close friend, Edward Coleridge,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My heart beats with joy at the prospect of Abraham
coming. O what a blessing it will be to a mind not only
beginning to be overwrought but beginning to be conscious
of it....  Abraham will sustain part of the spiritual and
intellectual strain which falls upon the head of such an
institution as this....  If I could but feel that I was so
growing in grace as to increase in fitness for the work as the
work itself increases, I could then bound over the sea and
over every New Zealand forest and mountain with the
lightest of hearts and the most buoyant of hopes. But
if the work should increase faster than the supply of inward
strength, and if help should be withheld in the form in which
it would be most welcome, by the subdivision of the diocese,
it is not any bodily decay which I fear so much as that
overmuch service may make my mind careful and troubled
about many things, and unable even in old age, to sit in
contemplation at the feet of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">THE CALL OF THE PACIFIC</span></h2>
<p>It will be remembered that through a clerical
error, the Melanesian Islands had been included
in Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s diocese. He did not forget
this, but he believed that his first duty was to
get to know New Zealand itself. When by his
various journeys on land, on foot or on horseback,
up the rivers in canoes, and round the
coast in little sailing vessels, he had learned
to know the work and needs of the Church in
New Zealand, and had by a second Synod held
in 1847 arranged for its organization, his thoughts
were free to go out to the vast stretch of ocean
and islands which by a mere accident had been
entrusted to his charge. An opportunity to
make a preliminary voyage to the islands was
given to him by the request that he should act
as chaplain on the <i>Dido</i>, a warship which was
being sent at the end of 1847, to investigate the
causes of an affray between the natives and two
English vessels. The islands were much visited
by traders chiefly in search of sandal wood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
and the conduct of these traders had again and
again aroused the animosity of the natives, who
had often avenged themselves by murder and
treachery, so that landing on the islands was
reputed very unsafe. On this first voyage
to the Pacific, the Bishop learned a lesson of great
use to him afterwards. He wanted to land on
the Isle of Pines, an island which had a bad
reputation. The captain and the officers of the
<i>Dido</i> in vain tried to dissuade him, but he got
into a small boat and rowed himself into the
lagoon. There to his surprise, he found an
English schooner. Its captain was trading for
sandal wood and, when Selwyn asked him how
it was that he could smoke his pipe contentedly
in the lagoon of one of the worst islands of the
Pacific, where a man-of-war was afraid to enter,
he answered, &ldquo;By kindness and fair dealing I
have traded with these people for many years.
They have cut many thousand feet of sandal
wood for me and brought it on my schooner.
I never cheated them. I never treated them
badly&mdash;we thoroughly understand each other.&rdquo;
In talk with this man, Captain Paddon, Selwyn
learned much about the islanders, how their
confidence could be won and how to treat them,
and also the necessity of avoiding those islands
where unprincipled traders had aroused suspicion
and anger. He used always to speak of
Captain Paddon as his tutor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The voyage on the <i>Dido</i> was a voyage of
observation. The Bishop had to discover how
the problems presented by Melanesia could best
be met. There were already missions of various
denominations at work in the islands. Heroic
work had been done especially by the London
Missionary Society. Both missionaries and
Christian natives had suffered death for their
faith. At Tonga he visited a Wesleyan station
and made friends with Mr. Thomas, the senior
missionary who had spent twenty years in the
islands. Selwyn was charmed with his schools
full of smiling children, and with the beautiful
mission chapel, which he described as &ldquo;a noble
building, without nails, bound together with the
cocoa nut rope, beautifully arranged in variegated
patterns.&rdquo; In visiting the missions of
other denominations, the Bishop did not feel
it right to join in their public services, but was
glad, when their guest, to share their family
prayers. In one island he found a village
divided into rival factions by the rivalry of two
native teachers, &ldquo;separate chapels, services and
systems attesting the power of Satan, even
in this peaceful island, in dividing the house of
Christ against itself.... This is one instance
out of many, and it will surely strike every
thoughtful Christian, that I, who have been
charged with bigotry and intolerance for advocating
unity and opposing dissent, should
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
have had the evils of schisms again and again
brought under my notice by members of the
English Independent body and of the Scottish
secession.&rdquo; How to avoid adding to the confusion
caused by religious differences, was one
of the chief problems which the conditions in
Melanesia presented to him, but he seemed to see
the future development clear before him. He
was determined not to encroach on islands
already occupied by other missions nor to
&ldquo;inflict upon those simple islanders all the
technical difficulties of English dissent.&rdquo; He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nature has marked out for each missionary body its
field of duty. The clusters of islands together like constellations
in the heavens seem formed to become new
branches of the Church of Christ, and each a Church complete
in itself. It is of little consequence whether these
babes in Christ have been nourished by their own true
Mother, or by other faithful nurses provided that they have
been fed by the sincere milk of the word. The time must
come, I think, when they will be no longer under tutors or
guardians, for this present government by English Societies
is admitted to be preparatory to the introduction of self-government
by native Churches, and then I shall be free
to communicate with every branch of the great Polynesian
family as with bodies in no respect liable to the imputation
of dissent or schism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another problem was presented by the great
variety of dialects spoken, sometimes more than
one in the same small island. Selwyn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a special interposition of the divine power
could have produced such a confusion of tongues as we find
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
here. In islands not larger than the Isle of Wight, we find
dialects so distinct that the inhabitants of the various
districts hold no communication with one another. Here
have I been for a fortnight working away as I supposed at
the language of New Caledonia and just when I have begun
to see my way, I learn that this is only a dialect used in the
southern extremity of the island, and not understood in the
parts I wish to attack first.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were also difficulties caused by the
unscrupulous conduct of the traders, and the
fear of consequent treacherous action on the
part of the natives. The number of the islands
made it impossible to contemplate providing
English teachers for each. The Bishop decided
that the only way to meet the need was to aim
at securing a sufficient supply of native teachers
and to raise up a native ministry. As he
thought over the call that came to him from this
vast region, he reproached himself for the
enforced delay in responding to it and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While I have been sleeping in my bed in New Zealand,
these islands have been riddled through and through by
black slug, the b&ecirc;che-de-mer, has been dragged out of its
hole in every coral reef to make black broth for Chinese Mandarins,
by the unconquerable daring of English traders, while
I, like a worse black slug, as I am, have left the world all its
field of mischief to itself. The same daring men have
robbed every one of these islands of its sandal wood, to
furnish incense for the idolatrous worship of Chinese
temples, before I have taught a single islander to offer up
his sacrifice of prayer to the true and only God. Even a
mere Sydney speculator could induce nearly a hundred men
from some of the wildest islands in the Pacific to sail in
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
his ships to Sydney to keep his flocks and herds, before I,
to whom the Chief Shepherd has given commandment to
seek out His sheep that are scattered over a thousand
isles, have sought out or found so much as one of those
which have strayed and are lost.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1849, the year after his voyage of observation
in the <i>Dido</i>, Selwyn sailed again to the Pacific,
this time in his own little yacht the <i>Undine</i>,
which he had used in his visitations of the coast
of New Zealand and the adjacent islands. The
<i>Undine</i> was a tiny vessel of only 21 tons. The
Bishop was his own navigator, and had no
charts to guide him in those unknown seas.
He set to work at once to make charts and maps,
which were afterwards thankfully accepted by
the Admiralty. He was so good at managing a
ship that the captain of a merchant vessel
once said it almost made him a Christian and
a Churchman to see the Bishop bring his schooner
into harbour. The <i>Undine</i> carried no arms;
from the first the Bishop, though taking all due
precautions, was absolutely fearless in landing
on the islands. He said: &ldquo;Where a trader will
go for gain, there the missionary ought to go for
the merchandise of souls,&rdquo; and again: &ldquo;It
is the duty of a missionary to go to the extreme
point of boldness short of an exposure to known
and certain danger.&rdquo; His departure from
Auckland is thus described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have just parted with our Bishop, and seen him
go off on his lonely mission voyage. Our feelings have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
strangely varied. We rejoice to see him enter on such a
work, and are thankful for these opening prospects; and
yet saddening thoughts and human fears will mingle with
high hopes: fears of perils by sea and of perils by the
heathen. Some at home and here talk of risks, and that
the Bishop has enough to do in his immediate diocese, and
that it is better to build up what is planted and the like.
But it seems like a great instinct in our Bishop&rsquo;s mind that
he must dig foundations and hew stones, and heave them
up single-handed; and they that come after him will do
the polishing and ornamenting. Not that he is unfitted
for the fine work. Few better able than he to construct
and build up. But then everybody likes the nice work.
Nobody likes the rough beginnings which have no present
results and small glorification. Perhaps the very thing
needful for him is to go with care on his lonely path sowing
precious seed. We would fain see him go in a larger vessel.
But he is anxious about incurring any extra expense.
He has no fear and has run so many voyages in his little
schooner that it is difficult to say much. He and his wife
are scrupulously careful in all their own expenses while so
large-hearted and handed in everything for the public
good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Undine</i> started with a prosperous run of
one thousand miles to Anaiteum, made in ten
days. Such a voyage was a great rest and
refreshment for Selwyn. He wrote to a friend
in England:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Few men are so entirely at their ease at sea, or so able
to use every moment of time, perhaps more effectually
because with less distraction than on shore. The effect
of this is that in a voyage of reasonable duration I can
master the elements of a new language sufficiently to enter
at once into communications, more or less, with the native
people. I feel myself called upon by these natural advantages
to carry the Gospel into every island which has
not received it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>At Anaiteum a Presbyterian mission was established,
and the Bishop in consequence did not
attempt to begin any work there, but had much
friendly intercourse with the Scotch missionaries.
He met there according to appointment
with Captain Erskine, commanding the
<i>Havannah</i>, and the <i>Undine</i> accompanied the
larger vessel in visits to some other islands.
Captain Erskine considered the Bishop&rsquo;s plan
of travelling with no arms of any sort as &ldquo;one
of no little risk.&rdquo; When he heard that some
natives of an island, notorious for its hostility
to white men, had been allowed to come on
board the <i>Undine</i>, he wrote that he &ldquo;was ready
to allow that it required the perfect presence
of mind and dignified bearing of Bishop Selwyn,
which seemed never to fail in impressing these
savages with a feeling of his superiority, to
render such an act one of safety and prudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop recognized clearly the risks he
ran in visiting the different islands and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite uncertain from visit to visit in what temper
the natives may be found. If any violence or loss of life
should have occurred in the interval between the missionary&rsquo;s
visits, his blood may be required as much as that of
any other white man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this cruise, which lasted only two months,
he went to New Caledonia, the New Hebrides
and the Loyalty Isles, and came across many
different men of many different kinds.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;On one day it is my lot to keep company with sandal
wood traders, and on the next with her Majesty&rsquo;s Men of
War. As sources of information, the sandal wooders are
most useful companions; I have received much kindness
and civility from them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He thus described his future plan for the
conversion of the Melanesian islanders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To select a few promising youths from all the islands, to
prove and test them, first by observation of their habits on
board a floating school; then to take them for further
training to New Zealand; and, lastly when they are
sufficiently advanced, to send them back as teachers to
their own people, if possible with some English missionary
to give effect and regularity to their work. All the ordinary
losses by sickness, violence and theft which occur frequently
where missionaries are stationed at once on unknown ground
will be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this first voyage he brought back five
boys, enough to crowd his tiny cabin. They
reached Auckland safely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The walk from Auckland to the College was most
amusing from the frequent exclamations of surprise raised
by my native companions at every new object which they
saw.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some months afterwards he had to start on a
second voyage to take back the boys to their
own homes, lest they should suffer from the New
Zealand winter. He could then write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We find that even this first experiment, small and imperfect
as it has been, has opened to us a way for future
these islands as strangers, but we have our own scholars
as friends and interpreters to explain our objects. The
report seems to be favourable, as we have now several
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
applications from the New Caledonian youths for leave to
go to New Zealand. At present I have no intention of
taking any, as the winter is coming on and they would
find the change to our climate very uncomfortable. But if
it should please God to prolong my life, I hope to return,
and with increased means of information to select carefully
the next class of scholars and to take them with me to New
Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rejoiced in the beauty of the islands and
felt hopeful about the future development of
their inhabitants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true that only man is vile, these people are the
most friendly people in the world.... To go among the
heathen as an equal and a brother is far more profitable than
to risk that subtle kind of self-righteousness which creeps
into mission work, akin to the thanking God that we are
not as other men are.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wished to put this Pacific work on a
permanent basis and believed that, if God
would enable him before his death &ldquo;to lay out
the ground plan of a great design, succeeding
bishops would not refuse to add each his course
of stone to the rising edifice.&rdquo; When shortly
after his return from this cruise he went in
September, 1850, to a meeting at Sydney of
the Synod of the Church in Australia, one of his
chief objects was to persuade the Australian
Bishops to form a Board of Missions. especially
with a view to the needs of Melanesia. His
proposals were sympathetically received, the
Australasian Board of Missions was formed, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the Melanesian mission was solemnly adopted
by the Australian and New Zealand colonies.
Selwyn expressed himself as willing to do the
active work of the Mission if Australia would
assist him with the necessary funds. Money
was raised in New South Wales to supply a
vessel of one hundred tons, the <i>Border Maid</i>,
for the Bishop&rsquo;s voyages to and fro to the
islands with his pupils, and Bishop Tyrrell,
of Newcastle, New South Wales, an old Cambridge
friend, agreed to accompany him on his
first voyage in the new mission ship.</p>
<p>On his return to Auckland Selwyn at once
founded a Branch of the new Board of Missions,
thus making the New Zealand Church from the
first recognize its missionary responsibilities;
his ambition was to make his diocese the great
missionary centre of the Southern Ocean. The
carrying out of his many schemes had been
made easier for him by the arrival this year of
his friend, Mr. Abraham, with his wife. Abraham
had at last found himself free to leave Eton
and now came to be head of St. John&rsquo;s College
at Auckland. With him came Mr. Lloyd,
another helper, and their arrival and the hopes
thus given of further development so encouraged
Selwyn that he was wont to call this year,
1850, his <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>.</p>
<p>The sight of what Selwyn had already accomplished
made a deep impression upon Abraham,
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
which finds expression in a letter home from
Mrs. Abraham.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do we find in him? All that he was; all that
we believed.... You can feel the deep joy it is to feel
this day by day pressed home to one&rsquo;s conviction ... to
find that it was not any mere fancy, any imaginary greatness
or goodness, with which memory and friendship had
invested him in absence, but that he was in his simple
unvarnished reality, more than all he (Mr. Abraham) had
thought and trusted to and reverenced for these nine years
past&mdash;the entire renunciation of self and all belonging to
him in comparison with the duty and the object of the
present moment is so shown forth in his daily life, so transparently
open to all who have eyes to see and hearts to
receive the witness of such an example, that one must be
dead and dull indeed not to feel continually the all-pervading
power of such a life.... One feels that he is the
one man to pioneer the way and lay foundations....
My husband owns that he cannot gainsay or resist the
wisdom with which he speaks, though he is thankful to
find the Judge quite joins with him in his feeling that a
drag-chain rather than a spur is needed on his favourite
Melanesian Mission; and is disposed to watch his widening
schemes in that direction with a zealous regard for this
country, which must after all be the real battlefield in
behalf of the coloured race, and also with anxiety for the
personal health and safety of the Bishop himself, which
they all feel is certainly risked in each one of these voyages....
I do not wonder at the hold these islands have upon
him, after hearing his stories of his intercourse with them,
and especially about the boys he had here last summer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Abrahams were both amused and impressed
by the quiet way in which the Bishop
walked &ldquo;through any mention of State interference
and ecclesiastical law apart from Church
authority.&rdquo; They saw at once how determined
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
he was to make the Church of New Zealand
independent and self-governed, and to make it
realize its responsibility for the education of the
people. In his discussion on these subjects he
went on to thoughts of the Church at home and
of the work of Bishops there, and said that at
home too the clergy must take education into
their own hands by doing the work, and that
there should be an &ldquo;episcopate of &pound;500 a year
bishops, given to hospitality and not clothing
flunkeys in purple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham wrote his first impressions of St.
John&rsquo;s College, to Dr. Hawtrey, the headmaster
of Eton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop and myself are the only persons in the
colony almost who possess libraries; and the taste for such
things has to be created, as at present a mere utilitarian
idea of education prevails. Perhaps for the purposes of
the settlers here and the clergy a practical education is the
best suited, and I must confess that I quite quail before the
attainments of some of my scholars, who will make most
valuable missionaries among natives and round a sea girt
isle. Only conceive what a thoroughly
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&eta;&sigmaf;
man will be formed out of a boy who at the age of nineteen knows
more divinity than most boys at Eton in the Sixth Form,
who is thoroughly acquainted with French and Maori ...
is a good musician and able to teach the natives singing&mdash;a
good mathematician and able to sail the <i>Undine</i> from
hence to the New Hebrides and back, taking sights and
managing rigging.... Of course none of them are scholars
in our sense of the words; they devote too little time to
scholarship, having to pay for their support by bodily
work, so that two hours a day, four times a week is all a
boy gets of school. He is either printing, or farming, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
weaving, or digging, or making shoes, etc., the rest of his
time. Altogether it is a strange life we lead here. I am
sure I never realized it before I came, but I will try to put
you in possession of our principle; and when I say our, I
mean the Bishop&rsquo;s&mdash;for only his vast head and noble heart
could conceive and execute so complicated a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first generation of converts to Christianity is
passing rapidly from this scene, and the middle-aged folk
now are very nominal Christians indeed. They have
abandoned cannibalism certainly, and the horrors of
frequent war, thank God, but their moral and religious
state is very questionable. The old chief close by us is a
heathen, and he and many of his people point to the bad
lives of the Christian people as their stumbling block....
The fact is that they are not educated. The Bishop was
told by the missionaries that it was impossible and visionary
to attempt to break through their habits. His faith was
too great to allow him to leave it unattempted, and his
perseverance too strong to be easily deterred or baffled.
He established the college, to which he draws as many as
he can afford, which is only fifty. He first has a native
school for children (it stands about a hundred yards from
this; his house and the chapel is between us). There are
twenty or twenty-five of these little brown mice, living in a
wooden Swiss-like cottage, with a master (a candidate for
Holy Orders) and an assistant, one of the scholars, to look
after them. They learn English, arithmetic, singing,
writing and scripture&mdash;dig in the garden, make and mend
their clothes which are not extensive. When they are
thirteen or fourteen they are drafted off into the labour
departments (to which twenty-five more belong and live in
different houses, under the superintendence of the students)
and become either bakers or cooks, weavers or shoemakers,
carpenters or farmers, etc., attending school half the day,
and working the other half at their trade. All these working
departments the Bishop is well able to superintend. He
might have made a capital farmer, or a good carpenter or a
weaver or a printer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;At 7 a.m. we all meet in chapel. At 2 p.m. hall, we all
dine together. There is an upper table for the clergy and
the ladies; the different departments dine together,
presided over by their foreman, at different tables&mdash;plain,
good, wholesome fare. From 4 to 6 school or work&mdash;at
6 tea in hall&mdash;7 chapel.... The attachment of the
natives to the Bishop is wonderful. They thoroughly
appreciate his care for them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Abraham&rsquo;s presence made it easier for
the Bishop to move about his diocese, now that
he had one whom he could thoroughly trust to
leave in charge at Auckland. When some
little time after his return from the Synod the
new mission ship, the <i>Border Maid</i>, arrived
with Bishop Tyrrell on board, he started in it
for another voyage to the Pacific, taking back
with him four boys who had been brought over
to school by Captain Erskine in the <i>Havannah</i>.
Two of the boys were to be landed at Erromango,
where some years before Mr. Williams, a member
of the London Missionary Society, had been
murdered. There the Bishop was very cautious
about landing, though the boys assured him
&ldquo;No fight, no fight.&rdquo; When the chiefs came
down to meet him, he landed and went two
miles inland with the boys to their home. There
he knelt down and said prayers with them,
bidding them tell their friends what they were
doing, and what it meant. The boys wept
when he parted from them on the beach.
Other boys, who had been at Auckland, were
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
visited on their islands. On one island, Neugone,
Samoan teachers were working and had
built a chapel in which Selwyn preached in
Samoan to a large congregation. They
earnestly desired a permanent minister, but it
was not possible yet to give them one, though
not long after Selwyn was able to place Mr.
Nihill there. Five boys were brought away for
training. One young chief was most anxious
to come, and wept bitterly when his father would
not allow it. The Bishop comforted him by
promising to call for him next time. The most
anxious moment of the voyage is described in a
letter from the Bishop of Newcastle to a friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest danger to which we were exposed arose from
the natives at the Island of Malicolo. Only one ship is
known to have visited this harbour before and the natives
did not know one word of English or of the language of the
other islands. Numbers collected on the shore as we
entered the harbour and as we wanted to replenish our
water we at once communicated with them.... The place
shown by them as the best for obtaining water, proved so
inconvenient, that the Bishop of New Zealand and myself
rowed along the shores of the harbour to find, if possible,
a more convenient stream or pool. We found one more
accessible and returned after an absence of two hours to
the ship. Whenever we left the ship, we always gave
directions to the chief mate to allow a few natives to come
on board at a time, if they came in their canoes, and wished
to see the ship, and seemed quiet and friendly. On our
return the mate told, us that they had allowed one or two
small parties to come on board, but that afterwards so
many came and looked so questionable, armed with their
clubs and spears, that he thought it prudent to refuse
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
permission to them to come on deck. The Bishop of New
Zealand still thought it important to procure some water,
so we arranged that we should not both go in the boats as
the place we had selected as the best for obtaining water,
while I remained in charge of the ship. At dawn the boats
went with casks to fetch the water. I was left in the ship
with the mate and one sailor, and two or three of the native
boys from the other islands. Within an hour after the
boats had left the ship, two or three canoes came off to
the ship, filled with huge men, most of them were armed
with their clubs and bows and spears. In the first canoe
the chief man was such a ferocious looking ruffian that I at
once determined he should not come on board. Later,
five or six other canoes came off to the ship, and there
must have been at least fifty of these huge men in them,
many armed. Every now and then one more forward
than the rest would take hold of the ship and plant his foot
on a slight projection, so that one spring would bring him
on deck. No sooner had he planted his foot and looked up,
than he saw me just over him directing him very calmly
but decidedly to get back into his canoe. All this time the
native boys from the other islands who were on board were
in the greatest terror.... After two hours the men in the
canoes consulted together, evidently came to the conclusion
that it was no use to try any longer, and began to move off....
Next came the most anxious hour that I have ever
passed. When the canoes had moved off a little way, they
stopped and every eye was directed towards the two boats
of the ship which were lying off the shore, where the water
was being fetched from a pool about a quarter of a mile
inland. The men in the canoes consulted together, then
changed their places, filling the two largest canoes with
those who were evidently the greatest fighters, and these
two canoes paddled towards the boats.... The danger
was lest the two canoes should reach the two boats and
overpower the two men before the Bishop of New Zealand
came down with his body of men from the water-pool.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
I called to the mate and asked whether we could render any
assistance? &lsquo;None my Lord.&rsquo; I paced the deck a few
seconds and then asked again, have we any means of self-defence
in the ship? The answer was, &lsquo;None.&rsquo; This
information did not disconcert me; I felt it a duty to
inquire whether anything could be done, and if anything
could have been suggested should at once have set about it.
But the thought that something fatal might happen on
shore brought with it a sickening feeling of reckless disregard
as to what might happen to myself. I therefore
paced the deck and rendered the only aid I could render&mdash;that
of fervent prayer to Almighty God.... I saw soon
the canoes reach the boats: I saw two of the natives in
one of the boats; I heard a noise and a shout from the
shore&mdash;I could not trust my eyes when I thought I saw the
boats move from the shore rowed by our own men&mdash;I
gave the telescope to the mate and eagerly asked whether
he could see the men in the boat and the Bishop with them.
He looked and answered, &lsquo;Yes, they are all there&mdash;and his
Lordship steers the first boat.&rsquo; The Bishop on reaching the
shore with his band of water carriers, had seen one of the
ship&rsquo;s boats waiting to receive them, surrounded by natives,
who were brandishing their clubs round the boy left in
charge and making all sorts of threatening gestures, while
he sat unmoved only quietly resisting their efforts to take
the oars from him. The Bishop and his water-bearers made
their way steadily onward to the water&rsquo;s edge. He said,
&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; and they walked into the water lifting their casks
higher and higher as they advanced. As they approached
the boat the natives made off.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This adventure illustrates the firm and
courageous way in which Selwyn met the
difficulties and risks that attended these voyages,
and the personal ascendency which he gained
over the islanders by his courage and demeanour.
Bold and fearless, he yet thought for everyone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
prepared for every contingency and knew how
to choose the right persons to trust.</p>
<p>The <i>Border Maid</i> brought back from this
voyage thirteen scholars from six different
islands, amongst them two who had gone away
with the Bishop and now returned after visiting
their homes. The Maori scholars at the College
went out to meet the long file of black boys on
their arrival, and there were many greetings and
much shaking of hands. Three weeks afterwards,
on All Saints&rsquo; day, both a confirmation
and a baptism service were held in the College
Chapel. The Bishop writes in his diary that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The candidates clothed in white robes represented people
speaking ten languages, gathered from one fifth part of the
world&rsquo;s circumference, from east and west, and one-tenth
part from north and south.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The voyages to the Islands had to be frequent
as the scholars could not stand the New Zealand
winter and had to be taken back to their islands
during the cold months. Their education was
continued during the voyage. The hammocks
in which they slept in the hold were rolled up
during the daytime, and the hold became a
schoolroom, where the same work hours as at
the College were followed. In 1852 the Bishop,
who was anxious to secure Christian wives for
his young men, was able to his great delight to
bring back two girls from the Islands. During
the voyage he himself made dresses for them
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
out of a patchwork quilt, and on reaching
Auckland proudly brought them up the beach,
one on each arm, dressed in the garments he
had made out of the quilt, ornamented with
scarlet bows. His voyages gave him opportunities
for showing kindness to other missionaries.
This year he took out with him a
Presbyterian teacher with his wife, a horse and
much baggage and landed them at their mission
station.</p>
<p>Between 1848 and 1852, he visited more than
fifty islands, and had given into his care forty
scholars speaking ten different languages. The
Melanesian mission was very dear to his heart.
He loved sailing about amongst the lovely
islands, and delighted in the friendliness shown
by the great majority of the people. But the
New Zealand colonists did not look at all
favourably upon this extension of his work,
and did not approve of his being so much away
from them. Some of his friends thought that
he exposed himself to too many dangers. Even
in England some said that he was neglecting
his diocese. To this he replied that Melanesia
was included in the diocese entrusted to him,
and though it might be urged that this was only
a clerical error, yet the Archbishop and Bishops
who had consecrated him had &ldquo;consigned to
him the oversight over the progress of religion
in the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Writing to his dear friend, Mr. Coleridge, he
defended himself as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For seven years, during the troubles of New Zealand,
I neglected altogether this part of my diocese, and now
bitterly rue the consequences of this delay, as fields then
untrodden by the foot of a missionary are now overrun with
Papists and others.... Considering that within the last
twelve months, I have visited every English settlement in
New Zealand (except Whanganui) of 150 inhabitants from
Stewart&rsquo;s Island to the Bay of Islands, and that the larger
settlements have been visited every year upon the average
at least once, since I arrived ... and that I have visited
on foot twice every mission station; and am now preparing,
at the end of my ninth year, to visit them a third time, in
the course of a walk of about one thousand miles ...
considering, I say, all these things, I think that objectors
had much better hold their tongues, and not &lsquo;compel&rsquo;
me to seem to &lsquo;boast&rsquo; when I would much rather dwell
in silence upon my own infinite shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His increasing knowledge of the islands confirmed
his sense of the extent and importance
of the work to be done, and he wrote in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The careful superintendence of this multitude of islands
will require the services of a missionary bishop, able and
willing to devote himself to the work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">CHURCH ORGANIZATION IN NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p>As we consider in detail any portion of Bishop
Selwyn&rsquo;s varied work, we must never forget
that behind the details of the moment, the great
work needed for the future was ever present to
his mind. Yet he was never lost in visionary
schemes, details did not escape him, attention
to them was one of the ways in which his great
plans were made possible. All that he did,
he saw in the light of the great call that he
believed had come to him, to lay in New Zealand
the foundations of a living Church, self-governing
and independent. He had no desire to be an
autocrat, but wished as far as possible to work
with and through others. It will be well to
bring together the various measures he adopted
for the organization of the Church, whilst
neglecting none of the work for education and
evangelisation which was so dear to him. We
have seen how one of his first acts had been
to appoint in 1844 an archdeacon, that he
might have at least one trusted adviser to whom
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
he could delegate some part of his responsibility.
Then followed the first tiny Synod of his clergy,
called two years later. He looked to the future,
but he built on the experience and traditions of
the past. He wrote to a friend in the year
that the first Synod met:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My first charge if I ever find time to write it, will be an
attempt to deduce a plan of operations, suitable to the
peculiar case of New Zealand, from the records of the first
three centuries of the Church. In my endeavours to avoid
all party shibboleths I am much assisted by the natural
effect of the native Church in enforcing simplicity of
doctrine and regularity of discipline. I hope to make this
a fulcrum for moving the chaotic mass of the English
settlements, which are more like a fortuitous concourse of
atoms than anything else, with the additional disadvantage
that every atom has an opinion and voice of his own, and
thinks himself a mountain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He longed for the help of others in the great
work before him, and for opportunities of consultation
with wise and experienced men as to its
problems. This first synod met at Waimate and
consisted of three Archdeacons, four priests and
two deacons. It was summoned &ldquo;to frame rules
for the better management of the mission and
the general government of the Church.&rdquo; It
dealt chiefly with questions of church extension
and with some of the difficulties found in all
missionary lands, problems concerned with
baptism and marriage in a population partly
heathen and partly Christian. But humble
though it was, it met with much criticism in
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
England, and was regarded by some as an
unlawful assumption of authority and independence.
It was the first attempted Synod of the
Anglican Church since Convocation was suppressed
in 1717. There were then no Diocesan
Conferences or other authorised meetings of
clergy and bishops. The Church was regarded
as a State Establishment, and some regarded
Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s Synod as an infringement of
the royal supremacy, and blamed the Bishop
for priestly assumption.</p>
<p>With one of the criticisms of his first Synod
the Bishop was quite ready to agree. It was
stated that it was not a true Synod, because the
laity were not represented. In 1847 at his
second Synod, he proposed a constitution of the
Church in New Zealand, according to which
representatives of the laity as well as bishops
and clergy should meet together, and he inaugurated
the discussions preliminary to its
adoption. To this Synod he delivered his
primary charge. In it he showed both how he
looked back and how he looked forward in
making his plans. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our present meeting may be looked upon as one of a long
series, beginning at the Council of Jerusalem, in which it
the will of God by the assembling together of the ministers
of Christ for social prayer and mutual counsel.... If I
did not believe that our position in this country, both as
regards the simplicity and primitive character of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Church establishment, and its freedom from all political
connexion, gives us good reason to hope that we may be
enabled to avoid the evils into which other Synods have
fallen, I should have shrunk from the course which I now
propose to you, and fallen back upon the practice sanctioned
by custom, if not approved by reason, of a formal charge
<i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i>, upon the authority of the Bishop alone. I
might then have found as has often been the case, that some
would have consented <i>ex animo</i>, some without consenting
would have obeyed conscientiously, some would have
denied that their promise of canonical obedience applied to
the points of which they disapproved. At the best there
would have been much to check co-operation and engender
distrust.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went on to speak of the missionary
obligations of the New Zealand Church, and said
that New Zealand must become a missionary
centre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot consider our work accomplished till every
dialect in the South Seas has its representative members in
our Missionary Colleges ... however inadequate a Church
may be to its own internal wants, it must on no account
suspend its missionary duties.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He expressed his horror of controversy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of controversy in general I would say that it is the bane
of the Gospel among a heathen people.... I can never
forget the pointed illustration of the old chief of Taupo, when
I asked him why he still refused to believe. &lsquo;Show me the
way,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have come to the cross road. Three
ways branch out before me. Each teacher says his own
way is the best. I am sitting down and doubting which
guide I shall follow.&rsquo; He remained in doubt till a landslip
burst from the mountain under which he lived, and overwhelmed
him with all his house.... The course seems to
be to teach truth rather by what it is than by what it is not.
Let us give our converts the true standard and they will
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
apply it themselves to the discovery and contradiction of
error.... Much of what has been said applies also to our
relations with our own countrymen. We cannot expect
unanimity, let us at least seek peace. Much has been
written upon unity, but as yet little has been done towards
a union of all religious bodies in one. This at least seems
clear, that such a union, however highly desirable, must not
be effected by a compromise of truth. When all shall have
thoroughly examined the grounds of their own belief, and
rejected such errors as they may find, then it is certain that
all must come to unity of doctrine, because all will have
been conformed to the same unalterable standard of truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of his own episcopal authority he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the monarchical idea of the Episcopate to be as
foreign to the true mind of the Church, as it is adverse to
the Gospel doctrine of humility. Let it never be thought
that I alone am interested in the good government of our
Church, and that you are merely subjects to obey. Whatever
interest I have in the work you have also.... I
would rather resign my office, than be reduced to act as a
single and isolated being. It remains then to define, by
some general principles, the terms of our co-operation.
They are simply these: that neither will I act without you,
nor can you act without me. The source of all diocesan
action is in the Bishop; and therefore it behoves him so
much the more to take care that he act with a mind informed
and re-inforced by conference with his clergy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desire of the laity to take part in the
work of the Church was shown by a letter
addressed to the Bishop in 1850, signed by both
clergy and laity, amongst whom were Sir George
Grey and Chief Justice Martin. In this they
spoke of the responsibilities of the New Zealand
Church as being the most advanced and remote
outpost of the Church of England, of the call
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
to them to aid in the foundation of a great
nation and in moulding its institutions as
well as of their duties to the heathen peoples
in their neighbourhood. They stated their
sense of the necessity for some speedy establishment
of Church government amongst them
which &ldquo;by assigning to each order in the Church
its appropriate duties, might call forth the
energies of all, and thus enable the whole Church
most efficiently to perform its functions.&rdquo;
To this letter an outline Constitution was
appended, which had been drawn up by Sir
George Grey during the enforced leisure of a
sick bed. It proposed that a General Convention
should be summoned, resembling &ldquo;that
which has proved so beneficial to our brethren
in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selwyn had the advantage of discussing this
matter at the Conference of Bishops in Sydney
which he attended the same year. In a Pastoral
Letter sent out in 1852, he explained further the
objects he was aiming at. A Constitution was
needed because the Church in New Zealand was
not established by law, and therefore a large
portion of the Ecclesiastical law of England did
not apply to it. If they were to have laws to
guide them, they must apply for the power
granted to all incorporated bodies to frame their
own bye-laws. He added a list of the general
principles which should guide the framing of such
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
bye-laws. During the two following years,
meetings were called in all the settlements in
New Zealand to discuss these principles. He
wished the constitution to have the full approval
of the people and not to be imposed upon them
by authority from above. The delight of the
laity at realising that they were once more part
of a living church is illustrated by the words of a
farmer who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard the church bell ring this evening and
summon me to the first vestry meeting I had attended for
twelve years, and for the first time in this country, I was
quite overcome and affected to tears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At these meetings the Bishop called the
attention of the people amongst other things
to the fact of their dependence for their religious
ministrations on money sent from England,
often from the savings of the poor. His plan
was to endow every minister to the extent of
half his income, and to leave the rest to be
supplied by his own people. In this way the
minister would be partially dependent on, and
partially independent of his flock. The principles
of the proposed constitution were thoroughly
discussed at these various meetings, often by
men who had little knowledge or experience
to bring to the consideration of the matter.
The Bishop bore patiently with questions and
interruptions not always of the most courteous
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
kind. In a letter written by one who was
present at these meetings it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I mention these facts to give you some notion of colonial
church life in its less interesting and romantic features.
There are some hard, coarse, rough scenes to be gone
through&mdash;such as would astonish an English bishop if he
were to come across them. It is just as well that people
at home should know that the trials of colonial bishops do
not so much consist in the pleasant excitement of walking
through the glorious forests, and swimming the rivers of
New Zealand, or the like, nor in the novelty and refreshment
of missionary work among a simple or savage people, but
in being brought into contact day by day with the rudest
and coarsest spirits of unrestrained colonialism, which
vaunts itself and prides itself in saying and doing the most
offensive things in the most offensive way. Our Bishop
has practically exemplified an old saying we used to have
at Eton, &lsquo;You must go on never minding.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop was willing patiently to let them
talk, hoping that &ldquo;they would feel their feet
for themselves and stand all the firmer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In England there was a good deal of difference
of opinion, even amongst great lawyers, as to
the status of the Church in the Colonies, and the
right of colonial bishops to hold synods or
conventions of their clergy in order to legislate
for the Church. Selwyn became convinced that,
in order to get the matter settled, he would have
to pay a visit to England and he began to
prepare to return home for this purpose. He
wished above all that the method should be
determined by which more bishops could be
appointed to aid in a work which it became
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
increasingly impossible for one man to carry
on. Both in the colony itself and in England,
many criticisms were made as to the way in
which he apportioned his time between the three
great claims made upon him, the evangelisation
of the Maoris, the care of the settlers, and the
mission to the Melanesians. In a letter written
in 1852, he speaks of a statement he had drawn
up as to the way in which he had spent his
time during his ten years in New Zealand, and
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The results are curious and illustrative of the life of a
colonial bishop, which can scarcely be understood and
certainly not felt by any of the good questionists in England.
One whole year I have spent at sea, between the English
settlements, distant one thousand miles at their extreme
points, and requiring a voyage of two thousand five hundred
or three thousand miles to visit them all. During
the whole of this year of voyages, I was lost to all the
direct objects of my office; but in that time my charge,
journals, study of languages and navigation, and the chief
part of my correspondence have been accomplished; all
bearing upon that work for which I live, and to which such
powers as God has given me of mind and body have been
devoted. It appears that the English and native duties
have occupied nearly equal portions of time, and the Northern
(that is the Melanesian) missions only half as much as
either of them; but the collegiate duties as being the
husbandry of my best garden plot, have absorbed as much
time as the English and native visitations put together.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His methodical and orderly habits which
made the arrangements of his tiny cabin a
wonder to all who saw it, his exactness and
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
punctuality, alone made it possible for him to
carry out such a multitude of varied duties.
His visitations were carefully planned so that
no part of New Zealand should escape his notice.
On a tour round the Southern Island in 1851,
he held forty-four confirmations, and confirmed
about three thousand candidates. His programme
for each day was marked with D.V.
and where the engagement was fulfilled, he
added D.G. After this particular tour he could
write in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;End of confirmation tour on which every D.V. has been
marked with a D.G. to the exact day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the tour had its own special disappointment,
for there were but few young people
amongst the candidates for confirmation. This
he attributed to the lack of schools, which he
must now try to get the missions to provide.
Meanwhile new settlers were constantly arriving.
In 1847 a large number of military pensioners
had been settled by the Government in the
neighbourhood of Auckland. No provision for
chaplains or for any religious ministry had been
made for them. The Bishop set to work at
once and provided each of these settlements
with a little wooden church. He himself, and
the young deacons working with him, conducted
the services in these little churches. They went
on foot through mud and mire every Sunday
to the different settlements, the Bishop always
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
taking the hardest part of the work and the
largest number of services. In the evenings all
the clergy and lay readers met together at St.
John&rsquo;s for what was called the &ldquo;Unity Service,&rdquo;
after being widely scattered for their different
duties during the day, and joined with the
students from the college, dark-faced islanders,
English and Maori boys, in a last act of prayer
and praise.</p>
<p>In 1850 an important new settlement was
made in the Southern Island near Lyttelton.
It had been planned in England and was carried
out under the auspices of what was called the
Canterbury Association, formed in order to
send out a band of settlers belonging to the
Church of England, accompanied from the first
by a number of clergy and teachers, and a
prospective Bishop, who came out to view the
land before deciding whether he would accept
the appointment. Selwyn was very glad to
learn that some one was coming who would
relieve him of the charge of the Southern
Island, but he was not previously consulted as
to the Settlement and doubted the wisdom of
the arrangements made. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My growing unpopularity with the Company for advocating
native rights is, I conclude, the reason why a plan like
this of the &lsquo;Canterbury Settlement&rsquo; is forced on in the same
hurried and reckless manner which has caused all former
disasters&mdash;without a single enquiry of any kind being
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
addressed to the Bishop of the Diocese. If I were a mere
land agent, my local knowledge of every part of New Zealand
both of the coast line and of the interior, with few exceptions,
wherever human beings are settled, might have
induced reasonable men to write to me before they pledged
themselves to such a partial and profoundly ignorant body
as the New Zealand Company. But the Company must
sell land or die.... I cannot compromise myself to a
recommendation of any site within the Southern Province
unless the whole be accurately mapped, and facility given
to every purchaser to know exactly what kind of land he is
buying.... Wherever the settlements be formed, the
actual surface of the country must be taken into account.
Let the site of every town, village, school, church, etc., be
marked before a single acre is sold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wrote thus on seeing the printed prospectus
of the Settlement. It had filled his mind
with anxiety because of his intense love for
New Zealand and his eager desire for anything
that might benefit the Church and the country.
But when the Canterbury pilgrims began to
arrive, he hastened to Lyttelton to greet them.
As soon as the <i>Undine</i> was seen to enter the
harbour, two of the newly-arrived clergy
hastened on board. One of them thus describes
his visit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Both wore cap and gown, at which the Bishop seemed
pleased (one wonders whether it would not have been
truer to say amused), they gazed around with awe and
interest until the awe at least was dispelled by the cordial
reception they met with, and the unequalled charm of the
Bishop&rsquo;s presence and conversation. The marvellous
neatness of that diminutive cabin and the ingenuity of its
arrangements, are never to be forgotten.... On the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
following Sunday the Bishop celebrated the Holy Communion
in a loft over a good&rsquo;s store, reached by a ladder,
the seats being extemporised by resting planks on sugar
barrels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop himself writes to a friend interested
in the Settlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am among the Canterbury pilgrims; and a very
good set of colonists they are, as far as I can judge. But
a great mistake has been made in sending out too many at
once, and in allowing any consideration to prevent their
instant occupation of land. They are not allowed to choose
till two months after their arrival, by which time many will
have become demoralized by idleness and desultory habits....
I repeat again and again the same advice: send out
your parochial staff ready organized&mdash;clergymen, landowners,
labourers, not turned adrift upon an interminable
plain: far less cooped up in a Dutch oven at Lyttelton;
but to go at once to a parish known and chosen by themselves,
and to a church and school already built; so that
not one single day&rsquo;s delay may occur in resuming those good
habits in their new country which they have learned in
England. I find neither church, nor school, nor parsonage
in existence. Money enough has been spent, but all in
civil engineering. Last Sunday I administered the Holy
Communion in a crowded loft over a store. I do not care
for these things if they are unavoidable; but where it
has been part of the plan from the first to put religion in its
right place, I do object to spacious and costly offices, long
lines of wharves, roads, piers, etc., and not one sixpence of
expenditure in any form for the glory of God, or for the
comfort of the clergy. I shall, of course, make the best of
the matter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few weeks later another ship arrived,
bringing more emigrants, several schoolmasters,
and the Bishop designate. Selwyn who had
been away on a further voyage, returned to
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
meet him, and at a conference with him and the
clergy of the settlement, agreed to resign into
his hands the southern portion of the diocese of
New Zealand. The meeting was held in an
unfurnished room in the immigration barracks
at Lyttelton. It was brought to a close by the
announcement made to Selwyn that the wind
was favourable for his departure. Before leaving
he expressed &ldquo;his great thankfulness at
finding such a spirit of unity among the clergy
of this new branch of the Church of God,&rdquo; and
gave them his blessing. He returned again
towards the end of the year to assist with his
advice in the organization of the new diocese,
so that all might be from the first established on
a sound basis. But the hope that he was going
at once to be relieved of the charge of the
Southern Island was disappointed. The Bishop
designate felt himself unfit for the post for
which he had been selected, and returned to
England. It was five years before a Bishop for
this new diocese of Christchurch was sent out.</p>
<p>Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s immense responsibility continued
unrelieved. He had not only the
supervision of all the missions to the Maoris,
the planning of the work amongst the Pacific
Islands, but the provision for the religious and
educational needs of the increasing number of
colonists who were attracted by the rich promise
of New Zealand. During these years he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
gained a full knowledge of the country. He
wrote in 1853:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The dim and visionary idea of New Zealand, which I used
to brood over in 1841, before we left England, is changed by
God&rsquo;s blessing to an accurate knowledge of every accessible
part of the coast, and of almost every inhabited place in the
interior.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of 1853, he had the great
joy of ordaining his first Maori Deacon, Rota
Waitoa, who had been for ten years his constant
companion in his travels. It was a consolation
in the midst of bitter sorrow, for he had been
obliged temporarily to close the College at
Auckland on account of the grave misconduct
of two in whom he had trusted, and which put
an end to his hope of educating together the
Maori youths and the sons of the colonists.
When the College was able to be re-opened it had
to be for white scholars only, and other provision
was made for the Maoris. Rota had adopted
every Christian and civilized habit, and had
risen from one post of usefulness to another and
been found faithful and blameless in all. The
older missionaries were doubtful of the wisdom
of ordaining a Maori, believing that it was
difficult to be sure that the tendency to barbarism
was yet eradicated. But the Bishop&rsquo;s
confidence in Rota was not disappointed, and he
served the Church faithfully till his death
twelve years later. Unlike the ordinary natives
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
who were generally characterized by great self-conceit,
he was unusually diffident of himself,
and he was always eager to seize any opportunity
of learning more. When he had worked
for eighteen months in the village which had
been put under his charge, he told his people
that he must go up to the College to fill his
seed bags again, having sown all that he took
down with him the year before. The English,
who saw him at the College on that visit, were
&ldquo;struck by the perfect ease and simplicity of
his manner, without the least assumption of
forwardness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This first ordination of a native marked an
important stage in the growth of the New
Zealand Church, but the difficult questions as
to the constitution of the Church could not be
settled without a visit to England, and the
Bishop had now made up his mind, to undertake
the long journey home. He started with Mrs.
Selwyn and his younger son, the elder was
already in England for his education, on the last
day of 1853, having spent twelve years of
arduous work in New Zealand. His desire was
to do his business in England and get back as
quickly as possible. He wrote during the voyage
to his friend, Mr. Coleridge, saying that his
objects were the subdivision of the diocese,
the enactment of free powers for the Church in
New Zealand to meet in Convocation of Clergy
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
and Laity and to manage its own affairs within
certain limits, and the recognition of his plans
as regards the Melanesian mission. He added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pray use your influence with our friends now in power
to give me quick dispatch, as Colonial Bishops being
unconnected with the State, are not used to ante-chambers
and only wish to get work done with as little formality as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he had thoroughly discussed his plans with
people in New Zealand he could say that he
came authorised by his people &ldquo;to take such
steps as might be necessary for carrying into
effect the wishes of his diocese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was much consideration of his proposals
and many discussions with the authorities,
but it seemed to them impossible to give legal
sanction for the organization of an independent
colonial Church. At the same time they said
that there could be no legal objection to colonial
bishops holding synods within their own
dioceses. Selwyn therefore gave up all attempts
to get legal sanction for the proposed Constitution
of the New Zealand Church of England.
On his return to New Zealand he at once proceeded
to make arrangements for the government
of the Church and the final acceptance of
its suggested Constitution.</p>
<p>Those members of the Church who were
willing to administer its property were asked
to associate themselves together on the basis of
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
<i>mutual compact</i>, and to establish a representative
governing body to manage its affairs and regulate
its extension. Selwyn summoned a general
conference of Bishops, Clergy and Laity to meet
on May 14th, 1857, and approve finally the
Constitution. In his opening address to this
Conference he said that as &ldquo;the colonial
churches must have laws for their own government,
and as neither the Church nor the State
at home is able to make laws for them, they
must be free to legislate for themselves.&rdquo; Whilst
in England he had drawn up the outline of a
constitution, based on his former proposals
and guided by the advice of eminent legal
authorities. This constitution he now submitted
to the Conference for their final approval.
In it the Church in New Zealand was described
as a Branch of the United Church of England
and Ireland, associated with the mother Church
by voluntary compact, and free to govern itself
through a representative body. It was to
maintain the doctrine and sacraments of the
Church of England, and to accept its book of
Common Prayer. In the main the constitution
followed the lines of that of the American
Episcopal Church. The Church of New Zealand
was to be autonomous and free from the State
Legislature. This Constitution was revised in
various particulars in later years, but for the most
part it stands as it was originally settled. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
was much criticism of it at first, especially in the
Canterbury Diocese, where more freedom for the
various diocesan conferences was demanded,
and objections were made to the powers vested
in the central authority. For a time there
seemed danger of a severance between that
diocese and the rest of the New Zealand Church.
Fortunately the firm and wise management of
the Bishop effected a compromise on the various
points in dispute. The Constitution was finally
settled at the General Synod held at Christchurch
in 1865 and at the same time steps were
taken which completely separated the Church
in New Zealand from the Crown, and gave it the
appointment of its bishops.</p>
<p>Whilst in England the Bishop had also made
plans for the division of his Diocese and secured
the appointment of three new bishops to whom
in the old way letters patent were to be granted
by the Crown, and they were consecrated in
England. After this the Bishops in New Zealand
were chosen by the Diocesan Synods.</p>
<p>The first General Synod under the new
Constitution met at Wellington in 1859. The
Bishop in his opening address spoke of it as the
fulfilment of hopes cherished during a period
of fifteen years. He told of the difficulties that
had to be surmounted before his hopes could be
realised, and how the Constitution was founded
on the basis of mutual and voluntary compact.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
The property of the Church was to be held by
trustees; the Church was to be governed by
diocesan Synods, and their work was to be
co-ordinated under the General Synod. In the
work of all these Synods the laity were to have
their full share. He spoke of the danger lest
they should be tempted to rely on mere external
and material organization, and trust to it
rather than to the life of the Spirit, but said
that it would be vain to seek for spiritual life
by neglecting outward organization; they must
trust to the quickening spirit to make them
living stones, so that each doing his appointed
work and using his own special gift, they might
see to it that their Church should grow into a
holy temple of the Lord.</p>
<p>He spoke of the chains with which the Church
of England had been bound by her past history;
of the abuses &ldquo;which had been encrusted on her
system,&rdquo; such as private patronage, the sale of
spiritual offices, the inequalities of clerical
incomes, and the repeated efforts which had
been made to remove them. From these chains
the Colonial Church was saved; as faithful
children it was their part to show how glorious
might be the purity of her doctrine and the
holiness of her liturgy, free from those chains.</p>
<p>There were to be diocesan boards to appoint
the clergy, whose maintenance was to be provided
by the Diocesan Synods, partly from
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
endowment funds, and partly by voluntary
contributions. This was a principle dear to
Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s heart, which he had advocated
ever since he came to New Zealand. The
discipline of the clergy was to be in the hands
of a Tribunal appointed by the Diocesan Synod
and presided over by the Bishop. The electors
to the Synods were to be those who declared
themselves willing to obey the laws of the Synod,
its members must be communicants. He then
described what would be the duties of the Synods.
Finally he dwelt upon their responsibilities for
the native races in New Zealand and Melanesia,
and on the urgent need to raise up a native
ministry. He rejoiced over the faithful men who
had already been ordained, but said it was
impossible not to feel some doubts as to the
future stability of the native Church. He said:
&ldquo;My recent journey through the Mission
Stations has left me in a balanced state between
hope and fear&rdquo;; fear caused by the signs of
decaying faith, and by the fact that the native
youth were &ldquo;departing from the example of
their fathers, given to self-indulgence, drunkenness
and sloth.&rdquo; He was convinced that the
time was coming when it would &ldquo;be found
impossible to carry on a double government for
the Colonial and the Missionary Church,&rdquo; but
their blending must be a gradual work though
it should be begun immediately. It was with
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
great thankfulness that he told the Synod of
the formation of the new missionary diocese
of Waiapu for the Southern Island, to which
he hoped to consecrate Archdeacon William
Williams. &ldquo;One whose age and experience had
often made him feel ashamed that he should
have been preferred before him.&rdquo; The three
new Bishops of Christchurch, Wellington and
Nelson, who had been appointed in England,
were present at the Synod and joined with him
at its close in consecrating William Williams,
who was thus the first Bishop to be consecrated
in New Zealand. Selwyn wrote of this to a
friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that you could have been present to see our little
church at the Antipodes, represented by its four Eton
Bishops, lighting a fifth candlestick to be a light to lighten
our native Christians. The new Bishop was already at his
work in New Zealand while I was still a boy at Eton; and
though a veteran, who might have claimed some relaxation
of his work, has just pulled down a comfortable house at his
mission station to remove to a wild tract of uncultivated
land, and there begin again the first perturbations of a
native school for the purpose of training up the New Zealand
youth to take their place in the new order of things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brief account of the organization of the
autonomous Church in New Zealand has been
carried to its fitting conclusion in the account
of the first meeting of the General Synod and
of the first consecration of a Bishop in the
country. Bishop Selwyn had accomplished the
great work which gave New Zealand a self-governing
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
Church, with a constitution sufficiently
elastic to allow it to develop in accordance with
its own needs, and yet safely established on those
&ldquo;fundamental principles,&rdquo; which would for
ever secure its union with the Mother Church.
By his skill and zeal in bringing this difficult
matter to a safe conclusion, he had not only
secured a great future for the Church in New
Zealand, but he showed the way to other
branches of the Anglican Church in other parts
of the world. His clear vision, his talent for
organization, his indomitable perseverance, his
conspicuous power in managing and persuading
men, had all combined to make it possible to
realize his object in the short period of eighteen
years, amidst all the pressure of other work,
the strain of constant journeyings to and fro
by sea and land, and the cruel anxieties of native
wars. What had been achieved filled him with
thankfulness and hope for the future. He had
worked throughout in full co-operation with
others, and on true democratic principles, as
befitted a Bishop in a new land. He had no
desire to be an autocrat or to win credit for
himself.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">BISHOP SELWYN&rsquo;S WORK IN ENGLAND FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS</span></h2>
<p>The primary object of Selwyn&rsquo;s visit to
England was to make arrangements for the
organization of the Church in New Zealand.
The result of his efforts in that direction has
been told in the last chapter. But his visit to
England was fruitful in other respects also.
He had no intention of lingering there, and had
written from his ship on the way to England
to his friend, Rev. E. Coleridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do not urge me to prolong my stay, but use your
influence to get my work speedily done, and send me to my
own element again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reached England with Mrs. Selwyn in the
Spring of 1854, just when the Crimean War was
beginning, but in spite of the pre-occupation of
the mind of the country with the war, his energy
and eloquence gained him a hearing for the
spiritual needs of New Zealand. He spoke and
preached in many different places, and four
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
sermons which he delivered before the University
of Cambridge created a specially deep
impression. He told his hearers that those who
came back from the Mission Field were not
likely to be able to add anything to the store of
learning at home, but that they might be able
to bring to them &ldquo;some deep experience from
the fountains of the human heart, some glimpses
of primitive Christianity granted to the servants
of God in their lonely mission-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dwelt much in these sermons on the need
for unity in the Church at home; it was not
then a question of re-union with other denominations
which concerned him; that question had
hardly arisen yet. It was unity within the
Church itself that he felt to be so urgent. The
controversies which were distracting it when he
returned to England had made a very painful
impression upon him. With characteristic tact
he attributed them to the increased interest in
religious questions roused by the two movements
which had sprung up in the Universities during
his absence, the Tractarian movement at Oxford
and the Evangelical movement at Cambridge.
These movements had made so great a change in
England in the thirteen years that he had been
away that he could say: &ldquo;now it is a very rare
thing to see a careless clergyman or a neglected
parish.&rdquo; He said that it was easy to see how
Christian zeal tended to religious strife whilst
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
it led to greater zeal in seeking religious truth.
The cure for the evils of controversy which he
offered to young men was &ldquo;to enter into life
burning to do their duty in that state of life
to which God may call them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The best
interpreter of Christian doctrine is Christian
work.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;For instance, in our
mission work, our standard of necessary doctrine
is, what we can translate into our native languages,
and explain to our native converts.
This we know to be all that is really necessary
for their salvation.&rdquo; This test would suffice
until the Church should be able to set up tribunals
of doctrine to decide &ldquo;whether the
increase of knowledge in the present day would
allow of stricter definitions or greater fulness
of language.&rdquo; Much that he said bearing on
the special difficulties of the time is of universal
application. &ldquo;There is reason to fear that a
great delusion often lurks under the plea of
conscience. An over-scrupulous conscience may
often be the mere veil for a lack of charity.&rdquo;
He spoke of how a true conception of the Church
would lead men to work amongst the poor and
the outcast; &ldquo;to deal with every single soul
as if our own lives depended upon the issue.
If this be done the Church will soon by God&rsquo;s
blessing reabsorb all dissent within herself,
for every sect is still part of the Church.&rdquo; He
believed that the great work given us by God
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
to do was &ldquo;too vast and too important to be
lost in unprofitable discussion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From thoughts of the Church&rsquo;s work at home
he passed on to her work in the Colonies, and
spoke of the call to provide for the spiritual
needs of the emigrants who were leaving England
in thousands to people the new lands overseas,
and of how the Church had at first neglected
this task. England &ldquo;had enlarged her empire
but she had not extended her Church; it was
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
alone that at first helped to save the settlers
from the guilt of first destroying their native
brethren, and then abjuring religion and denying
God.&rdquo; He spoke of the need for &ldquo;men of
energy, and piety, and learning in every colony&rdquo;
and said that the Church would be disgraced
for ever if it neglected either the needs of the
poor at home or of the settlers overseas. He
urged the men listening to him not &ldquo;to forget,
in the comforts of home, what it is to be good
soldiers of Jesus Christ&rdquo;; adding &ldquo;I forbear
to speak of myself because it has pleased God
to cast my lot in a fair land and in a goodly
heritage, in the healthful climate of New
Zealand and among the clustered isles and on
the sparkling waves of the Pacific. There is too
much real enjoyment for me to be able to
invite anyone to unite himself with me as an
exercise of ministerial self-denial.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>He described the kind of men who were
wanted in the Colonies: &ldquo;men who can live
in the midst of disturbing elements and yet
themselves remain unshaken ... men who can
stamp upon a new community an image of
themselves, and yet give to God all the glory ...
men who can be dependent upon their congregations,
without being subservient; and bold
in rebuking sin, yet gentle in their admonition
of the sinner. Above all, we need men who can
stand alone, like heaven-descended priests of
the Most High God, where a few shepherds feed
their scattered flocks, with no comforter but the
Spirit of God&mdash;no friend but their ever present
Lord.&rdquo; He was convinced that there were such
minds amongst those listening to him. &ldquo;But
they are as backward to offer as the Church is
backward to call. One or other must break
through this natural reserve. Offer yourselves
to the Archbishop as twelve hundred young men
have already offered themselves to the commander-in-chief.
Let the head of our Church
have about him, as his staff, or on his list of
volunteers, a body of young men, who are
willing to go anywhere, and be anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his last sermon he spoke of work amongst
the heathen. &ldquo;There, too, above all things, there
was need for unity, &lsquo;a real and visible unity&rsquo;;
no inward and spiritual unity can act as an
outward evidence: the keen sighted native
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
convert soon detects a difference of system....
We make a rule never to introduce controversy
among a native people, or to impair the simplicity
of their faith. If the fairest openings for
missionary effort lie before us, if the ground has
been pre-occupied by any other religious body,
we forbear to enter. And I can speak with
confidence upon this point from observation
ranging over nearly one-half of the Southern
Pacific Ocean, that wherever this law of religious
unity is adopted, there the Gospel has its full
and unchecked and undivided power. Nature
itself has so divided our Mission Field that each
labourer may work without interference with
his neighbour. Each island circled with its
own coral reef, is a field in which each missionary
may carry out his own system with native
teachers trained under his own eye.... Many
of these islands I visited in their days of darkness,
and therefore I can rejoice in the light
that now bursts upon them, from whatever
quarter it may come. I feel that there is an
episcopate of love, as well as of authority ...
above all things it is our duty to guard against
inflicting upon them the curse of our disunion,
lest we make every little island in the ocean a
counterpart of our own divided and contentious
Church. And further I would point to
the Mission Field as the great outlet for the
excited and sensitive spirit of the Church at
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
home. There are minds, by nature intolerant
of rule, in whom not even the spirit of the Gospel
can implant an acquiescence in anything which
they believe to be an error.... Such men
would be the very salt of the earth, if they
would but go out into the Mission Field....
They would find satisfaction for their zeal in
its free and unbounded range ... the work
itself will humble them ... will correct its
own errors.... Is it then a hope too unreasonable
to be entertained that the power
which will heal the divisions of the Church at
home, may come from her distant fields of
missionary work?... Let it be no longer a
reproach to the universities that they have sent
so few missionaries to the heathen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These four sermons are a revelation of
Selwyn&rsquo;s inmost mind, whilst they have a
special interest of their own as throwing light
on the condition of the Church both at home
and overseas in the middle of the nineteenth
century. They reveal his deepest thoughts
on the questions which the experiences of his
own varied life had brought to him, as he dwelt
on them during his long voyages and his many
journeys on horse and foot through the wilds of
New Zealand. They show us what the man had
become, what life had taught him; they tell
of his hopes for his Church and its work throughout
the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>These and his other sermons and addresses
given during his visit to England aroused
much interest and produced a deep impression.
One young man after hearing his appeal, being
possessed of &pound;12,000 offered it all to the Bishop
for his work. The Bishop, however, refused
to profit by what might only be a passing
impulse and would not accept it. He needed
money for his work, but still more he needed
men, men of the right sort, and to his great
joy, one young man, of just the kind he needed,
was amongst the fruits of this visit to England.
John Coleridge Patteson, fellow of Merton
College, and now working as a curate in Devon,
had long cherished the desire for mission work
overseas. It had been aroused in him by Selwyn&rsquo;s
farewell sermon at Windsor, when he was
still an Eton school boy. But he had felt it
right to stay in England as long as his father,
who was old and in poor health, lived. Now it
came about that he met Bishop Selwyn whilst
he was visiting his father, Judge Patteson, an
old friend. Walking with him in the garden,
the Bishop asked him if his life satisfied him,
and Patteson told him of his desire at some
future time to go out as a missionary. The
Bishop replied that if he really meant this, he
ought not to put it off, he should go when in full
strength and vigour. They talked long and
earnestly and finally Patteson agreed to leave
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
the decision in the hands of his father and the
Bishop. When Sir John Patteson heard of his
son&rsquo;s wish, his first exclamation was: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
let him go&rdquo;; but it was followed in a moment
with the words: &ldquo;God forbid I should stop
him.&rdquo; When finally he spoke to the Bishop on
the subject he said: &ldquo;Mind, I give him wholly,
not with any thought of seeing him again. I
will not have him thinking he must come home
again to see me.&rdquo; Selwyn thankfully accepted
the gift. With his whole heart he invited
Patteson to come and work with him, saying,
that it would be a great comfort to have him
for a friend and companion.</p>
<p>It would seem as if from the first Selwyn
saw in young Patteson the man he needed as
Bishop of Melanesia. The same week that he
received Patteson&rsquo;s offer, he wrote an appeal
to his friend, Rev. E. Coleridge, to help in raising
the money needed for this bishopric. He said
that if only the organization of the Church in
New Zealand had been a little more advanced,
he would gladly have undertaken the charge of
Melanesia as his own diocese. The sum of
&pound;10,000 for which he asked was speedily
collected. One of the most enthusiastic supporters
of the Melanesian Mission was Miss
Yonge, the novelist, a close friend of the
Pattesons. Later on she gave the whole proceeds
of one of her most popular books, <i>The Daisy Chain</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
to the support of the Mission.
Now the readers of <i>The Heir of Redcliffe</i>, which
first won her popularity, made a special contribution
to help to raise funds to provide a new
vessel, the <i>Southern Cross</i>, for Selwyn&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>The Bishop had hoped to return to New Zealand
in the <i>Southern Cross</i>, but there proved to
be faults in its construction, and its departure
was so much delayed that he was obliged to
start on March 29th, 1855, in a quicker vessel,
leaving the <i>Southern Cross</i> to follow. He had
spent ten busy months in England and though
deeply grieved at parting from his aged father
whom he could not hope to see again, he was
eager to get back to his work.</p>
<p>Mrs. Selwyn and Patteson went with him,
his two sons had to be left in England for their
education. The necessary parting from them
was a bitter grief, but he had faced what it
would be some years before, on the death of a
baby daughter whom in his busy life he had only
known for twelve days. He had then written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot and must not look to children as a source of
personal and domestic enjoyment, but may hope to rejoice,
if it be God&rsquo;s will, in reports of their well doing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patteson&rsquo;s companionship was now a great
source of joy and consolation. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Coley Patteson is a treasure which I humbly set down as
a divine recompense for our own boys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said of him that he possessed the three
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
indispensable requisites for his special task:
&ldquo;the sailor&rsquo;s gift of enduring hardness, the
priest&rsquo;s gift of drawing men by cords of love and
detaining them by gentle discipline, the linguist&rsquo;s
gift of quickly mastering many dissimilar
tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached Auckland sooner than was
expected by their friends there. A strange
vessel was discerned threading all the intricacies
of the harbour, without having fired the gun for
a pilot, and at once people began to say: &ldquo;there
must be someone on board who knows what he is
about, and all the tides and currents of the
harbour; and who so likely as the Bishop.&rdquo;
His friends thought he looked dreadfully worn
on his arrival. Every one was painfully struck
with his appearance, but the cause was soon
discovered. He had been up for two or three
nights piloting the ship down the coast and
through all the islets. He soon recovered his
good looks and it was gladly recognised that he
&ldquo;was all the better for English air and for the
bracing of mind and body&rdquo; that his journey
had given him.</p>
<p>Bishop Selwyn could now look forward to
working under new and more satisfactory conditions.
The next few years saw the final
steps taken for the complete organization of the
Church in New Zealand which has been described
in the last chapter. Instead of having the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
whole charge of New Zealand he would now have
four other Bishops working with him, as well as
duly organized synods by means of which the
laity too would share in the work of the Church.
The lands which he had been careful to acquire
as sites for churches and to provide endowments
could now be vested in trustees, and proper
attention could be paid to the rapidly increasing
number of colonists, attracted specially during
recent years by the discovery of gold in the
Southern Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">THE MELANESIAN MISSION</span></h2>
<p>A fortnight after Bishop Selwyn reached
Auckland on his return from England, the
<i>Southern Cross</i>, the new mission ship, arrived.
She was first sighted on a very wet day, and as
soon as the Bishop was sure it was her, he called
Patteson to come with him to meet her. Patteson
describes the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I hurried on waterproofs knowing that we were in for
some mudlarking. Off we went, lugged down a borrowed
boat to the water. I took one oar, a Maori another, the
Bishop steering. After twenty minutes pull we met her,
jumped on board, and then such a broadside of questions
and answers. Mudlarking very slight on this occasion, but
on Tuesday we had a rich scene. Bishop and I went to
the <i>Duke of Portland</i> and brought off our things ... the
custom is for carts to go over the muddy sand ... in
went our cart, with three valuable horses, while the Bishop
and I stood on the edge of the water. Presently one of the
horses lost his footing, and then all at once all three slipped
up. Instanter Bishop and I had our coats off, and in we
rushed to the horses, such a plunging and splashing but
they were all got out safe. &lsquo;This is your first lesson in
mudlarking, Coley,&rsquo; was the Bishop&rsquo;s remark.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Selwyn could sail for his first voyage in
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
the <i>Southern Cross</i>, he was called upon by the
Governor to go to make peace in a native
quarrel, which threatened to lead to trouble with
the settlers. The disturbance had arisen in the
neighbourhood of Taranaki, called by the
colonists New Plymouth. A chief had tried to
sell some land, the ownership of which was
disputed, to the English, and another chief,
Katatore, had shot him down in cold blood,
unarmed. The settlers fearful of the disturbance
that might follow, asked that some troops
should be sent to protect them, but the Governor,
thinking that the presence of English soldiers
would only add to the difficulty, begged the
Bishop to go down to see whether he could bring
about a peaceful settlement. The Bishop started
at once accompanied by Dr. Abraham and
his faithful Maori Deacon, Rota. They had
a hard fortnight&rsquo;s walk through difficult country
to the Pah, that is the camp, of William King,
a well known native chief, who had taken the
part of Katatore, and here they met with a
friendly reception. The next day the conference
began in Katatore&rsquo;s Pah, and Abraham
thus describes what happened. They found
&ldquo;one hundred men or so within; all were
seated on the ground to hear what the Bishop
had to say. After a few minutes a man dressed
like a would-be flash criminal at Newgate came
up to us. It was Katatore, a little cunning,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
ill-favoured looking rascal, dressed in a black
paletot, moleskin trousers, boots and a little
black hat on the top of an immense bush of hair.
He then told us the story of the murder. When
he came to it, the Bishop said: &lsquo;So then you
killed an unarmed man in cold blood for the
matter of land?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then you repeated
the act of Cain towards Abel, and in the
sight of God and man you are a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man started up in great wrath, but the
Bishop calmly repeated it. The man started
on his feet and left the ring of people, muttering
and growling; but his own people did not seem
disposed to support him on that point, nor
to question the Bishop&rsquo;s judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some days after, the soldiers arrived, and the
natives grew very excited thinking that the
Bishop had broken faith with them; but he
reassured them and finally after giving good
advice to both sides in the dispute restored
peace. Abraham writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was very striking to see the men&rsquo;s delight when he
wound up his speech with their old song, the Maori equivalent
for &lsquo;Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home.&rsquo; All the
good advice seemed to tell but little, but this quotation
set the whole party on the alert.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the days spent in this work of peace-making,
Selwyn held many services with both
colonists and natives, and persuaded the colonists
to provide themselves with churches.
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Whilst waiting for the steamer which was to
take him away, he with his party set to work
to mend a road full of great holes, which he
had in vain tried to persuade the people to
mend. They made the road passable in a
day and a half&rsquo;s work; and were watched by
the passers-by with amusement, but unfortunately
not with shame for their own idleness.</p>
<p>The Bishop was violently attacked in the
local papers for his conduct in the Taranaki
dispute. In one of them it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop Selwyn is again lending his blighting influence
to New Zealand, has again taken the murderer by the hand....
It is reserved for the Bishop of New Zealand to use
his undoubted influence to shield notorious criminals from
justice when those criminals appeal to his sympathies
through the medium of a dark skin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was accused of preventing the sale of land
to the settlers in New Plymouth. Thinking
that some members of the Church might have
been offended by the reports they had heard
of his opinion and conduct, he felt it to be a
religious duty to explain his opinions in a
pastoral letter to them. In this he stated what
he considered to be the cause of the hostility
between the Maoris and the settlers. He said
that land had been acquired too hastily without
sufficient investigation of the titles, and went
on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My advice to the natives in all parts of New Zealand has
always been to sell all the land which they are not able to
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
occupy or cultivate. I had two reasons for this: first to
avoid continual jealousies between the races; and secondly
to bring the native population within narrower limits,
in order that religion, law, education and civilization might
be brought to bear more effectually upon them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He referred to the strong feeling amongst the
Maoris for their land, and to their accurate
knowledge with regard to its ownership, saying:
&ldquo;No menaces of military interference are likely
to have any effect upon men who from their
childhood, have been accustomed to regard it as
a point of honour to shed their last drop of
blood for the inheritance of their tribe.&rdquo; He
expressed his conviction &ldquo;that the lives and
property of our fellow settlers, scattered as they
are, can only be preserved by the greatest
forbearance and the strictest justice in our
dealings with the native people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s return to Auckland, he
ordained a second Maori Deacon, Levi, a man
of 38, whose character had had long testing,
and whose final preparation for ordination he
had begun immediately on his return from
England. He was now free to set off on his
first voyage with Patteson in the <i>Southern Cross</i>.
This was to be a visitation tour to the Chatham
Islands and to the Southern settlements in New
Zealand. Selwyn was able to leave the vessel
in charge of Patteson and to make some long
journeys on foot. He had planned a journey of
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
one thousand miles and fixed the exact time
which it should take. A week before the
appointed end he wrote to Mr. Abraham asking
him to meet him at a certain place at 1 o&rsquo;clock
on the day fixed. Mr. Abraham writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As my watch pointed to the hour I looked up and saw
him emerge from a bush looking well, wiry and bushy. He
had walked five hundred and fifty-miles and ridden four
hundred and fifty in the course of the last three months,
having examined and confirmed one thousand, five hundred
people. He was alone nearly all the way and had
great difficulty getting the horses he did, so engaged are
the people in their cultivations, etc., that they could not
spare time to go with him.... He gave an amusing account
of the way in which he shamed them sometimes into giving
him a horse to ride. He would go to a village and ask for
a horse and guide. There were none was the answer. He
would point to a herd of thirty or forty not far off&mdash;no one
knew to whom they belonged. He would then put down
his pack and begin to throw out the most useless articles,
and pack it up again and begin to strap it on. &lsquo;What are
you about?&rsquo; &lsquo;Lightening my burden for a walk.&rsquo; This
touched some woman&rsquo;s heart, who would either herself
fetch, or urge her husband to get a horse. One morning at
dawn, as he was just starting on his lonely march he found
a woman standing with a horse ready for him.... The last
month&rsquo;s journey was the worst, perhaps, as he was obliged
to leave his blankets behind to lighten his shoulders, and
had to sleep under his tent with nothing but a thin maude
these cold autumnal evenings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thought that soon there would be another
Bishop to care for these scattered southern
settlements must often have cheered Selwyn
during his lonely wanderings.</p>
<p>His thoughts were now turning to the Pacific
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
Islands which he hoped would be the sphere of
Patteson&rsquo;s future work. On Ascension Day,
1855, he left Auckland in the <i>Southern Cross</i>
again. Ascension Day was his favourite day
for starting, for he felt the charge ringing in his
ears: &ldquo;Go ye and teach all nations.&rdquo; He
went first with Mrs. Selwyn and Patteson to
Sydney. He wished to get permission to set
up his school for the young Melanesians in
Norfolk Island. He had become convinced
that it was impossible to go on bringing the
young islanders to school at Auckland, and then
on account of the climate, to have to take them
back after a few months to their own homes.
This was much too expensive and wasteful
a method to be continued, and he wished to
find a suitable island where a school and a
centre for the mission might be set up. Norfolk
Island struck him as eminently suited for the
purpose. It had been used as a convict settlement,
but this had now been given up. Selwyn
had visited the island with Sir George Grey,
who approved of his idea, and wrote to the
home government asking that the disused prison
and a portion of the land should be granted to
the Bishop for his school. Objections were
made in some quarters because of another
proposal for using Norfolk Island. There had
been discovered in a Pacific Island named
Pitcairn, an English population who proved
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
to be the descendants of a certain John Adams,
the leader of a mutiny in a Government vessel
called the <i>Bounty</i>. Adams had brought up the
children of the mutineers who survived and
their descendants with great care, during the
years in which they had lived unknown and
separated from the outer world. Now that they
had been discovered in their lonely home, it was
considered that they were too many to go on
living on the little island of Pitcairn, and the
English Government intended to transport them
to Norfolk Island. Objections were made in
England to the idea of bringing native islanders
from the Pacific to live alongside with the
Pitcairners, lest they should corrupt these
interesting descendants of English mutineers,
who, it was asserted, had grown up in a state
of primitive innocence under a patriarchal
system. Bishop Selwyn, however, urged that
it would be good for the Pitcairners to help in
the work of training the natives and of navigating
the Mission vessel. But the Governor of New
South Wales would not agree to his proposal.
The Bishop was much interested in the Pitcairners
and waited to see them on their arrival
at Norfolk Island before he started for the Pacific.
He was warmly welcomed by them. The
careful provision of John Adams had seen to
it that they were brought up as Christians,
but naturally none of them had been confirmed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
It was decided therefore to leave Mrs. Selwyn
on the Island to teach and prepare the girls and
women for confirmation, whilst Selwyn and
Patteson went for their cruise to visit the
northern Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Before leaving Sydney, a crowded meeting
was held by the Australian Board of Missions
to hear Bishop Selwyn speak on the Melanesian
Mission, and at this meeting Patteson was
introduced by the Bishop as his dear friend,
one for whose companionship he ought to
thank God. After this they took Mrs. Selwyn
to Norfolk Island and sailed for the Pacific.
They went first to the Presbyterian mission at
Anaiteum, and deposited goods and letters that
they had brought for the missionaries, Mr. and
Mrs. Ingles. Patteson much admired their
schools and wrote of their work as full of hope
and encouragement. After this many islands
new to the Bishop were visited. Near one of
them they came across a brig with a sandal wood
trader who was notorious for &ldquo;dark deeds of
revenge and unscrupulous retaliation upon the
natives.&rdquo; In the past the Bishop had been one
of those who had helped to bring him to justice,
but he had remained friends with him and had
baptised his only son. Now he introduced
Patteson to him, saying, &ldquo;Mr. Patteson is come
from England on purpose to look after these
islands.&rdquo; He was convinced that the knowledge
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
that there were those who watched their
doings would have a restraining effect upon the
traders.</p>
<p>Patteson was able to learn from the behaviour
of the Bishop how to be on the look out for
signs of danger. Selwyn&rsquo;s quick eye was always
on the watch and without any apparent suspicion
of fear, he was ever on the alert to detect
any slight intimation of possible danger. On
one occasion whilst they were happily bartering
fish hooks for cocoanuts, the Bishop, to Patteson&rsquo;s
surprise, made a sudden sign to come away.
When they were in their boat he said: &ldquo;I
saw some young men running through the bushes
with bows and arrows, and these young gentry
have not the sense to behave well like their
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s method in his work among the
islands has been described by one who watched
it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On first invading the land he tries to make a favourable
impression on the people&rsquo;s minds by presents, and by letting
them see that he is not come to trade. This he does by
leaving his boat ten or twenty yards from the reef, where
some hundred people are standing and shouting; he then
plunges into the water arranging no end of presents on his
back, which he has been showing to their astounded eyes
out of the boat. He probably has learnt from some stray
canoe or a neighbouring island the name of the chief. He
calls out his name; he steps forward; the Bishop hands him
a tomahawk, and holds out his hand for the chief&rsquo;s bow
and arrows. The old chief with innate courtesy sends the
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
tomahawk to the rear, to show that he is safe and may place
confidence in him. The Bishop pats the children on the
head, gives them fishhooks and red tape, for there is an
enormous demand for red tape in these islands. Probably
then the Bishop has some &lsquo;tame elephant&rsquo; with him&mdash;a
black boy from some other island&mdash;and he has clothed him,
and taught him to read or the like; and he brings forward
this specimen and sample, and tries to make them understand
that he wants some of their boys to treat in like
manner. The Bishop gets as many names written down as
he can and picks up as many words as he can; establishes
a friendly relation, and after a while swims off to his boats.
Next year he will go and call out the names of his old friends,
get two or three on board, induce them to take a trip with
him while he goes to the neighbouring islands. So he
learns their language enough to tell them what he has
come for.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this trip with Patteson, he landed on
sixty islands, and they brought back thirty-three
scholars, who were looked upon as Patteson&rsquo;s
boys. They stopped at Norfolk Island
to hold what Selwyn described as &ldquo;one of the
most remarkable confirmations in the history
of the Church. The whole adult population
of the Pitcairn Islanders, except those who were
too feeble to attend, presented themselves to
me in nine classes to be examined and confirmed.&rdquo;
The eldest of the candidates, a woman
over seventy, was a daughter of John Adams.
The service was held in the old convict chapel,
which opened on to the prison yard, &ldquo;in every
corner heaps of rusty fetters and cast-off
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
garments.&rdquo; The Confirmation was followed by
a Celebration of Holy Communion.</p>
<p>This time the boys from the Islands had again
to be taken to Auckland as no other place was
ready for them. Selwyn wrote from there to
Judge Patteson expressing his delight in the
help given him by his son:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed most thankfully acknowledge the goodness
of God in giving me timely aid when I was pledged to a
great work without any steady force to carry it on. Coley
is the right man in the right place physically and mentally....
You know in what direction my wishes tend, viz.,
that Coley, when he has come to suitable age, and has
developed as I have no doubt he will, a fitness for the work,
should be the first island Bishop.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some years would have to pass before these
wishes could be fulfilled, but already in 1856,
Selwyn had the joy of welcoming Dr. Harper,
appointed Bishop of Christchurch, who came out
with all his family, immediately after his consecration
in Lambeth Chapel. Selwyn went
to Christchurch to meet him in the <i>Southern
Cross</i> and wrote in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Went on board at 8 took off the Bishop and his whole
family in our two boats; carried them to the <i>Southern
Cross</i>; whole Harper family seated round our cabin, fourteen
or fifteen happy faces. Went on shore, borrowed
trucks, pulled baggage up bridle path; three cheers on
the top.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bishop Harper was installed at once and
Selwyn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This day fifteen years I left England, and this morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
I woke up with a thankful feeling that my load was at
length lightened by the transfer to the Bishop of Christchurch
of one-third of New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both he and the colonists in the other
provinces were impatient that the remaining
dioceses which had been fixed upon should
be speedily completed. Selwyn wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The number of persons to be confirmed is not the labour,
but the distance to be gone in search of them. My average
is about one candidate for confirmation for every mile of
travelling. In all other respects of organising institutions
and giving a tone to a new society, it is absolutely necessary
that a bishop should be early in the field and have a field
within the compass of his powers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selwyn&rsquo;s care for the interests and needs of
the colonists in New Zealand never distracted
him from the wider mission field amongst the
heathen, which was ever so dear to his heart.
The arrival of Bishop Harper was followed in a
few months by the meeting of the Conference
at Auckland, which finally settled the constitution
of the New Zealand Church as described
in the last chapter. Whilst Selwyn was busy
with it, Patteson made a voyage alone to take
back the boys from the Islands, as the New
Zealand winter was coming on. The Conference
over, Selwyn started with Patteson for a long
cruise in the Pacific, first leaving Mrs. Selwyn
at Norfolk Island to carry on her work amongst
the Pitcairners. A long and prosperous voyage
followed during which many islands were visited.
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
In three there were urgent demands that they
should be given a teacher, but the Bishop had
none to give. All that could be done was,
wherever possible, to persuade boys to come
back with him to be taught. Finally after a
cruise of four months they returned to Auckland
bringing with them thirty-three Melanesians,
gathered from nine islands and speaking eight
languages. They had visited sixty-six islands
and landed eighty-one times, wading and swimming;
they had visited amongst others, some
islands where the London Missionary Society
had been at work, and where the native teachers
had been left for a long while without any
English missionary. They now gladly turned
to Bishop Selwyn for advice and help. But
nearly all the islands they visited were still
untouched by any missionary work. A second
voyage was made that year, and on that
occasion, the <i>Southern Cross</i> ran aground, in
the lagoon at New Caledonia. After many
exertions she was got off the ledge on which she
had stuck, but it was impossible to be certain
that her bottom was uninjured. There were
no divers to be got, but as one who was present
described the scene: &ldquo;the Bishop was equal
to the occasion. He caused the ship to be
heeled over as far as was safe; and then,
having stripped himself to his tweed trousers
and jersey, in the presence of the captain of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
<i>Bayonnais</i> (a French warship that was in the
harbour) and some of his officers, and amid their
exclamations of admiration, made a succession
of dives, during which he felt over the whole of
the keel and forward part of the vessel, much
to the detriment of his hands, which were cut
to pieces by the jagged copper; and ascertained
the exact condition of her bottom and the
nature of the injuries sustained. No wonder
that the next day, after dining on board the
Frenchman, he was sent away with a salute of
eleven guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this accident happened, the Bishop
was on his way to call for Patteson who had
been left on the Island of Lifu with his scholars.
Now the <i>Southern Cross</i> had to be taken to
Auckland to be repaired and contrary to his usual
punctual habits, he was a month late in reaching
Lifu. There followed a rapid voyage back,
picking up scholars by the way till forty-seven
were collected, amongst them three young
married women and two babies; with the crew
there were sixty-three persons in the little ship.
Patteson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As you may suppose the little <i>Southern Cross</i> is cram
full, but the Bishop&rsquo;s excellent arrangements in the construction
of the vessel for securing ventilation, preserve us
from harm by God&rsquo;s blessing. Every day a thorough
cleaning and sweeping goes on and frequent washing, and
as all beds turn up like the flap of a table, and some thirty
lads sleep on the floor on mats and blankets, by 7 a.m. all
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
traces of the night&rsquo;s arrangements have vanished. The
cabin looks and feels airy; meals go on regularly....
A vessel of this size unless arranged with special reference
to such objects, could not carry safely so large a party,
but we have nothing on board to create, conceal or accumulate
dirt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School and prayers were held regularly every
day. Part of the Bishop&rsquo;s own cabin was
screened off for the three women and two babies;
and he himself looked after them, washing the
babies and tending the women when sick.</p>
<p>Selwyn was grateful indeed that it was now
possible happily to leave all these new scholars
at Auckland under Patteson&rsquo;s care, for plenty
of work awaited him. He had to start off at
once on a confirmation tour of one thousand
miles and then be at Wellington early in the
coming year for the meeting of the first Synod.
The year, 1858, that was drawing to a close, he
described as &ldquo;a year of many blessings. Two
prosperous voyages to the Islands, one prosperous
voyage to the Southern Settlements,
one-third of the Visitation Tour by land accomplished,
the consecration of the Bishops of
Wellington and Nelson.&rdquo; These two, both
consecrated in England were old friends; his
fellow worker, Archdeacon Abraham, had been
appointed Bishop of Wellington, and Rev. E.
Hobhouse, Bishop of Nelson.</p>
<p>In 1859, after the Synod was over, Selwyn
made his last voyage to Melanesia again in
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
company with Patteson. They touched at
Lifu where they had before visited the native
teachers belonging to the mission of the London
Missionary Society. These men, as they had
not had an English missionary among them for
a long while, implored to be connected with the
Anglican Mission. But they were told that two
missionaries from L.M.S. were on their way from
Sydney to Lifu, and that it would do harm to
have two rival systems on the island. Patteson
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They acquiesced but not heartily, and it was a sad
affair altogether, all parties unhappy and dissatisfied and
yet unable to solve the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They called at Lifu again on their way back
and found that the two missionaries had arrived,
but learned also that there were two French
Roman Catholic priests in the north of the
island who were attracting many to them. So
again possibilities of true comity disappeared,
and the simple islanders were disturbed by the
unhappy differences between Christians.</p>
<p>After this voyage, Bishop Selwyn left to
Patteson the whole guidance of the Melanesian
mission. He had served his apprenticeship
under the Bishop and gained a full knowledge
of the nature of the work, and had shown that
he possessed the gifts necessary to carry it on,
so that he could be given full responsibility for
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
what had been to Selwyn one of the most
delightful parts of his great work.</p>
<p>To Patteson it had meant much to begin his
work in close association with one whom he
loved and admired as he did Bishop Selwyn.
He still looked constantly to him for help and
support. He wrote to his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of course no treat is so great to me as the occasional
talks with the Bishop. Oh! the memory of those days and
evenings on board the <i>Southern Cross</i>. Well, it was so
happy a life that it was not good for me, I suppose, that it
should last.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not yet possible to move the school
for the Melanesian boys to Norfolk Island, but
a more sheltered spot was found for it temporarily,
opposite to the entrance of Auckland
harbour. St. John&rsquo;s College was reserved entirely
for the sons of colonists. A new master,
Rev. B. Blackburn, had been found in England
by Abraham who, as Archdeacon, had been its
head till he was appointed Bishop of Wellington.
When Mr. Blackburn was offered the post he
accepted saying with what intense pleasure he
would work under as great a man as Bishop
Selwyn. To which Abraham answered: &ldquo;he
is a great man and would appear so to his valet
if he had one.&rdquo; Blackburn was not disappointed
when he first saw Selwyn on arriving
at Auckland. He described him as &ldquo;a king
every inch of him; he would rule by a look, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
stoop to perform the most menial office without
the slightest loss of dignity.&rdquo; After helping
to carry the newcomer&rsquo;s luggage from the ship,
the Bishop suggested that they should go to the
chapel to give thanks for their safe voyage, and
after a little service of prayers and psalms laid
his hands on each, down to the baby in arms,
giving them his blessing. Mr. Blackburn writes
further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop Selwyn had a love of work, and great power of
endurance. I have heard of his taking eight services in
one day. When 10,000 soldiers were landed in New Zealand
with only one chaplain (and he a Roman Catholic) the
Bishop felt it was his duty to provide for them: he started
a number of services and held Bible classes with the men.
The soldiers were enthusiastic about him. He knew
exactly how to adapt his language to them. It was amusing
to hear the officers speak of him. They not only admired
him as a bishop, but they discovered in him great power
for taking in the details of military life. They used to say
that it was a shame he was not a general. The naval men
were equally enthusiastic about his seamen-like qualities.
They all agreed that he would have made a first rate
admiral.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1861, Patteson was consecrated first Bishop
of Melanesia. Lady Martin describes the consecration:
&ldquo;It was altogether a wonderful
scene: the three consecrating Bishops, all such
noble-looking men, the goodly company of
clergy and Hohua&rsquo;s fine intelligent brown face
among them, and the long line of island boys and
of native teachers and their wives were living
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
testimonies of mission work.&rdquo; To Selwyn,
Patteson was like a son, and in the sermon
preached at his consecration he said, as he
gazed on one so dearly loved: &ldquo;May Christ be
with you when you go forth in His name and for
His sake to those poor and needy people.&rdquo;
The consecration marked the final achievement
of independence by the New Zealand Church.
So far no bishop had been appointed in the
Church overseas except under letters patent or
under mandate from the Crown. If this
necessity for constant reference to government
authority in England had continued, the progress
of the Church would have been subject
to needless limitations. Selwyn, always marked
by wisdom and caution as well as by his zeal
for the development of the independent Church,
after much anxious consideration, suggested
to the Colonial Secretary that the difficulty
about the appointment of a bishop would be got
over if the New Zealand bishops were allowed
to exercise the powers inherent in their office,
as bishops of a distinct province of the Church,
without any mandate from the Crown. This
was allowed, and henceforth the Church overseas
was free to develop on its own lines, without
interference from the Colonial Office and its
legal advisers. Thus after nineteen years of
work, the Bishop who had been given the sole
charge of New Zealand, and who had started
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the mission to Melanesia, saw himself surrounded
by five brother bishops, with the missionary
obligation of the Church to the Pacific islands
fully recognized, and entrusted to a man whom he
loved as a son, and who was specially gifted
for this work.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">THE MAORI WARS</span></h2>
<p>Bishop Selwyn had helped to make peace at
Taranaki (New Plymouth) in 1855, but discontent
continued to smoulder both amongst
the Maoris and the Colonists. The English
continued to be eager to acquire more land
and not scrupulous enough as to the means used
to acquire it. Disputes about title deeds and
the right to certain bits of land were frequent.
The Maoris were suspicious of the constant
encroachments of the British power. They felt
that by degrees their country was passing from
them into foreign hands. They had no representation
in the Parliament which had been set
up in New Zealand by the Constitution of 1853,
and practically no share in the general government
of the country. Colonel Browne, the
Governor, was obliged to report to the Colonial
Office in England the unsatisfactory state of
affairs. The difficulties were increased because
the respective powers of the Governor and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
executive were not clearly defined, and by the
want of sympathy with the natives shown by the
colonists. Maori chiefs were often treated with
indignities when they went to Auckland. Bishop
Selwyn said that &ldquo;he was quite ashamed to
travel with his native deacons, men who dine
at his own table and behave there like gentlemen,
because he cannot take them into public
rooms where a tipsy carter would be considered
perfectly good society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the first trouble at Taranaki had been
settled for the time, Bishop Selwyn uttered the
solemn warning which he was so soon to see
justified that &ldquo;while nothing is more easy than
to extinguish the native title, nothing will be
found more difficult than to extinguish a
native war.&rdquo; Slowly the country was drifting
towards war. In the Waikato country, the
Maori chiefs held a conference in 1857, at which
both Selwyn and the Wesleyan missionaries
were present, and the chiefs chose a king for
themselves. No rebellion was meant, for they
put up the flag of their chosen king and the
Union Jack side by side on the same staff,
and the Governor did not think it necessary to
take this king movement seriously. In Taranaki,
the chiefs had also formed a land league and
refused to sell land to the whites. This was
very irritating to the settlers along the coast,
who saw land, of which they were in great need,
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
lying idle. When one chief of his own accord
sold some land to the whites, the chief of the
Maori land league refused to allow the sale.
The Governor, however, maintained that the
sale was legal, and sent troops to the spot to
support the rights of the purchasers. This was
the beginning of long and disastrous war. At
first the Maoris gained some advantage over the
troops and the settlers were much alarmed.
It was feared that the war would spread to the
Waikato, and the general anxiety increased
when the irritation of the natives was inflamed
by the discovery of a Maori, lying killed by a
gunshot wound in the forest thirty miles south
of Auckland.</p>
<p>A body of armed Maoris gathered to avenge
his death on the settlers, who fled in terror from
their homes. Selwyn at once hastened to the
spot to make peace. He rode twenty-four
miles through the night, and then walked through
the wood wading in mud up to his knees to the
place where the fighting party were expected to
land in their canoes. He wrote to his son:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We could see at once by the open and bright expression
of their countenances, that they did not mean mischief.
The afternoon was spent as usual in much talk upon the
subject and ended with evening service in a large house, filled
with about two hundred men, with their arms piled around
the central pillars.... We were glad to find that they
were inclined to go back quietly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afterwards he visited and pacified other natives
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
in the district, and encouraged the settlers to
return to their homes, promising to remain with
them till the danger was past. One of them
wrote afterwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And so he did, guarding us with jealous care, never seeming
to sleep soundly, for upon any unusual noise in the night,
he was up and out in a moment. On the Sunday he
conducted in our little schoolroom divine service, and
preached a sermon never to be forgotten&mdash;inspiring trust
and confidence in God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selwyn&rsquo;s plea which he submitted in a
formal memorandum to the Governor, was that
the rights of the New Zealanders as British
subjects should be considered identical with
those of the English, that the rights of the
Maoris to the soil where the title deeds had not
been extinguished should be recognised; that
all native customs in connexion with proprietary
right should be respected, that disputes
should be submitted to a competent tribunal,
and that for the moment there should be an
armistice. But he was not listened to, and the
settlers denounced his conduct as political
interference. They said that &ldquo;no right to
interfere between Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government
and her native subjects could be allowed to any
minister of religion.&rdquo; In his reply to these
criticisms he said (1861) &ldquo;as the earliest settlers
in this country&mdash;as agents employed by Government
in native affairs&mdash;as intimately acquainted
with the language, customs and feelings of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
native race&mdash;and above all as ministers of
religion having the highest possible interest
at stake&mdash;we assert the privilege which the
Crown allows to every man of laying our
petitions before the Crown and the Legislature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this difficult moment Sir George Grey was
asked to return as Governor to the Colony which
he had administered so wisely and where he was
respected by all. For a moment there was
peace, but as the soldiers were still in the land
there was no sense of confidence or security. The
Bishop went on with his efforts for peace, and
his consequent unpopularity with the colonists
continued to grow. He attended a great assembly
of the natives in the Waikato, and from there
went on to the English settlement at Taranaki
where he was met on the beach by a mob who
shouted: &ldquo;Three groans for Bishop Selwyn,&rdquo;
and followed him with groans till he turned round
and faced them saying: &ldquo;Now it is more
English-like to look me in the face and tell me
your grievances.&rdquo; This they did with much
frankness, interspersed with rude outcries.
They accused him of grasping lands for the
Church, of loving power, of reviving all the old
abuses of England. From this he went on to
discuss matters with the natives, who for the
most part received him with much friendliness,
though at one place they said that no minister
should go through their land. But he slipped
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
off in the dusk to the next village and when he
came back, the old chief apologised and said:
&ldquo;Now let us how d&rsquo;ye do, and henceforth all
ministers may come and go as aforetime. You
are the great billow that has crushed the canoe;
you are the great fish that has broken through
the net.&rdquo; Alone and unarmed he went through
all this disaffected district. He knew the people
well and sometimes by a joke, sometimes
by a serious word, sometimes by a parable
could turn aside their anger and win them to
listen to him.</p>
<p>The natives at this time were very indignant
because the Governor had forbidden them to
have arms; and one chief had said to him:
&ldquo;My custom is to give my enemy a weapon if
he has not one, that we may fight upon equal
terms. Now, O Governor, are you not ashamed
of my defenceless hands.&rdquo; Soon after this
an English carter and his boy were murdered
by the Maoris. Shortly afterwards, the Bishop,
on his travels through the country, was sitting
round the fire with a large party of natives,
who were telling him some of their national
myths. He said: &ldquo;Now I will tell you a ghost
story. There was once a man who dreamt that
he was sitting with a large party round the fire,
when out of the fire rose the figure of a man who
said, &lsquo;O Governor if I had an enemy and he had
no weapon, I would give him one before we
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
fought. O Governor were you not ashamed of
my defenceless hands?&rsquo; The people all applauded,
but the dream went further. &lsquo;After
a time another figure rose up slowly out of the
fire, with a white face, very pale, with blood
streaming down; the figure was dressed like
an English boy and held a bullock whip. He
too stretched out his arms to the Maoris and
said, &lsquo;Were you not ashamed of my defenceless
hands?&rsquo;&rdquo; The Bishop refused to interpret
the story, but it was passed on amongst the
Maoris, and told by many a camp fire. All knew
its meaning.</p>
<p>On one of these walks, the people in a particular
village were persuaded not to receive the
Bishop, but to offer him a pigstye for his night&rsquo;s
shelter. The Bishop at once set to work to turn
out the pigs, clean the stye and make himself
a bed of clean ferns. This made the astonished
Maoris say: &ldquo;You cannot degrade that man
from being a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time an uncertain kind of peace
prevailed, but the irritation among the natives
was all the time on the increase, and the trouble
more and more took the form of hostility on the
part of the natives as a whole to the whites.
The chiefs in the Waikato began to gather
their forces to come to the help of the Maoris
in the Taranaki district. Bishop Selwyn,
anxious to check the growth of this hostile
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
Maori feeling, went to a Conference of Maoris,
where on the Sunday the Maori chief preached
to the assembled people on the text: &ldquo;Behold
how good and joyful a thing it is, brethren, to
dwell together in unity&rdquo;; and spoke of the
gain it was that the Maoris were now joined
together as one brotherhood under a Maori
king. When the next day the Bishop was
allowed to speak to the people, he said: &ldquo;Here
I am a mediator for New Zealand. My word
is mediation. I am not merely a Pakeha
(Englishman) or a Maori; I am a half-caste.
I have eaten your food, I have slept in your
houses; I have talked with you, journeyed
with you, prayed with you, partaken of the
Holy Communion with you. Therefore I say
I am a half-caste. I cannot rid myself of my
half-caste; it is in my body, in my flesh, in
my bones, in my sinews. Yes, we are all of
us half-castes. Your dress is half-caste&mdash;a
Maori mat and English clothes; your strength
is half-caste&mdash;your courage Maori; your
weapons English guns.... Therefore I say
we are all half-castes; therefore let us dwell
together with one faith, one love, one law.&rdquo;
He proceeded to implore them to allow the
Waitara case about the disputed land to be
tried by law; and that all together should set
right the wrong which had been done by men
on both sides. Finally he turned to the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
assembly and said: &ldquo;O all ye tribes of New
Zealand, sitting in council here, I beseech you in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in whom we
all believe and hope, agree to the proposals
by which we shall all live in peace and happiness.&rdquo;
Some were convinced, but the majority
refused to give up the lands. It was not long
before hostilities began. Sir George Grey came
down to investigate the question of the claim
to Waitara, but he brought troops with him and
the suspicious Maoris felt this meant war.
They ambushed a small party of soldiers consisting
of two officers and seven men, and killed
all but one. Sir George Grey, though in the
meanwhile he had discovered that the Maori
title to the Waitara was sound, felt that British
authority must be vindicated and the murderers
punished, so fighting began.</p>
<p>We are not concerned to follow in any detail
the course of the war, but only to speak of
Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s activities during it. Ten
thousand troops had gathered in the country
and there was not a single chaplain with them.
The Bishop therefore joined the army as
chaplain. He hoped thus not only to minister
to the troops, but to be in a position to protect
his native teachers and Christians. He lived
in camp, pitched his own tent and shared the
life of the soldiers, who admired him for his
courage and endurance. An English officer
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
describes how he first saw him. Looking
through his telescope he perceived the figure of a
man on foot rapidly making his way to the
mission station; after a while he came to a
small stream, and was observed feeling for its
bottom with a long stick; when it proved too
deep to be forded he stript, tied his clothes in a
bundle on his head and swam across. Selwyn
was on his way to warn a native clergyman of
the coming of the English soldiers, and to protect
him and his school.</p>
<p>During the trying months of war which
followed, he did all he could to help both sides,
and thus earned the criticism of both colonists
and Maoris, they could not understand his
position, nor perceive that his one desire was to
mitigate the cruel sufferings of war. &ldquo;If there
must be war,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our great effort ought
to be to debrutalise it, and the army from the
General downwards, have shown every willingness
that it should be so.&rdquo; He held constant
services for the soldiers, attended to the
wounded, buried the dead, and fortunately got
permission from the War Office to appoint
three other chaplains to assist him. During
these days he wrote (December 4th, 1863):
to his sons in England:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange thing to be moving up the Waikato with
an army, after twenty years of an annual visit of a peaceful
kind. To see the hills crowned with English forts, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
steamers smoking on the river, is a strange and to me a
painful subject of reflection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sought for wounded men, both Maori and
English, in the swamps after an engagement,
fearless of stray gunshots. A naval chaplain,
who was helping him, was riding with him one
day through dense bush, said to be infested
with Maoris, when they came to a part of the
road cut up with deep ruts on the side of a steep
hill. The Bishop jumped from his horse and
proceeded to fill up the ruts so as to save the
wagons for provisioning the troops from being
capsized. Further on, he found an Irish soldier
lying drunk and bareheaded, and got down to
drag him into shelter saying: &ldquo;Those men do
not know the danger of sunstroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the misery of watching these scenes of
war was added the bitter disappointment of
seeing the conduct of the natives. Selwyn wrote
to the Bishop of Adelaide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have now one simple missionary idea before me&mdash;of
watching over the remnant that is left. Our native work
is a remnant in two senses, the remnant of a decaying people
and the remnant of a decaying faith. The works of which
you hear are not the works of heathens; they are the works
of baptized men, whose love has grown cold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Maoris could not understand the Bishop&rsquo;s
presence with the English soldiers and looked
upon him with suspicion as having gone over to
the cause of their enemies, not recognising that
he could not leave the troops without some one
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to minister to their spiritual needs. The
English officers soon learnt to love him and to
admire his devotion and courage. On a Sunday
he would ride many miles, holding seven or
eight services in the day. There was a long ridge
of about two miles exposed to the fire from the
Maoris below which connected two redoubts.
The Bishop rode along it at full canter, and the
officers used to watch him through their field
glasses. They would see a puff of smoke and
then the Bishop still galloping along, and say:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, they missed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was comforted sometimes by hearing of
truly Christian acts done by Maoris. One
Maori General was an old pupil of the Bishop&rsquo;s;
he himself tended a wounded English prisoner all
through one night, and when the man asked for
water and there was none in the Maori camp,
he crept out through the fern into the English
lines and brought back a calabash of water for
the dying man. The Maori clergy to the
Bishop&rsquo;s great comfort were faithful all through
the war.</p>
<p>Lady Martin thus describes the effect of the
war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One by one the large flourishing schools on the Waikato
and Waiapu rivers had to be closed, with their branch village
schools under native teachers, which had become centres of
light. The fine country which we had seen covered with
wheat and crops became a battlefield&mdash;the mills were
closed, the churches built by the natives were often used
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
as barracks for the troops ... our bay became deserted.
No invalids were brought to be nursed, no canoes heavily
laden with produce skimmed across the harbour. It
seemed as if the pleasant intercourse with the Maoris,
which for twenty years had made our lives so bright was at
an end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1864, a new horror was added to the war
by the sudden appearance amongst the Maoris of
a fanatical sect, which gathered round an insane
chief who professed to have received revelations
from the angel Gabriel. His followers called
themselves Hau Haus. In a condition of wild
excitement, indulging in excesses of every kind,
they marched through the land claiming the
allegiance of other natives. Infuriated by
meeting resistance from some loyal Christian
natives, they vowed vengeance to all missionaries.
It was in this mood that they reached
Poverty Bay, just as two missionaries, Volkner
and Grace, arrived in a small schooner bringing
medicines and food for the people in the Bay
who were suffering from an epidemic of fever.
Volkner was seized and murdered next morning
in a revolting way, whilst Grace was taken
prisoner. As soon as this news reached Bishop
Selwyn he hastened to Poverty Bay to try to
rescue Grace. At Poverty Bay he found Bishop
Williams in whose diocese it was, and with him
a great crowd of loyal natives. He described
his adventures in a letter to Mrs. Selwyn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Went to the Bishop&rsquo;s house, found all well and thankfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
acknowledging the steadfastness of their people, who
had gathered from all parts for their protection. Went
out to a meeting at which the Bishop&rsquo;s army appeared in
fighting costume, with more of Maori-usage than I liked to
see, as I would rather have seen the native clergymen with
a hundred quiet men in brown coats than four hundred
native warriors in brown skins.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These men expressed themselves determined
not to allow their Pakehas to be touched, but
they would not help to attack the murderers of
Volkner. They even made conditions about
the release of a Maori prisoner before they
would write a letter asking for the release of
Grace. Selwyn had to send a schooner to fetch
this prisoner and then went off with the letter
demanding Grace&rsquo;s release to Opotiki, and sent
boats to the shore which brought off Grace and
other white people who were there. He then,
to his great regret, had to hasten back to Auckland
for the Synod; he believed that the
English clergy and others in that district were
still in great danger. He doubted, however,
whether he could have done more to help them
as he had now become such an object of hatred
and suspicion to the rebel Maoris.</p>
<p>After a year of fighting the Maoris were
driven back and dispersed. No regular peace
was made but both sides were weary of war,
and the English troops were withdrawn. It was
many years before the interior of New Zealand
was really at peace and safe for settlers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>At the end of the year (1865) the Bishop
wrote to an old friend in England:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How much of the buoyancy of hope has been sobered
down by experience! when instead of a nation of believers
welcoming me as their father, I find here and there a few
scattered sheep, the remnant of a flock which has forsaken
the shepherd. I do not know how far it is right to go among
my people, though, in former times, peace or war made no
difference in their willingness to receive me. At present
we are the special objects of their suspicion and ill will.
The part that I took in the Waikato campaign has destroyed
my influence with many. You will ask then &lsquo;Did I not
foresee this? and if so why did I go?&rsquo; I answer that I
could not neglect the dying and wounded soldiers. Then
there were many wounded Maoris brought in from time to
time to whom it was my duty to minister. Add to this
two of our mission stations had been occupied by a native
clergyman and catechist, whom no threats could induce to
leave their posts after the English missionaries were advised
to retire. It was my duty to see they were not injured
when our troops advanced.... This has thrown me
back in native estimation more, I fear, than my remaining
years of life will enable me to recover.... In the midst
of these sorrows we have solid comfort in the sight of the
stability of our native clergymen who have never swerved
from their duty.... The real cause of war in New Zealand
has been the new constitution, and the cause of the greater
bitterness of the strife has been the new element of confiscation
introduced by the colonists against the will and
express orders of the Home Government.... A Maori
cares more for his land than anything else.... We have
every reason to think that the worst is now past.... We
shall probably settle down upon the unsatisfactory basis of
the questionable possession of one or two millions of very
indifferent land, and of the entire repudiation of the Queen&rsquo;s
authority over the whole interior of the Northern Island.
This is the result of seeking first &lsquo;the other things&rsquo; instead
of the &lsquo;one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>The war was drawing to a close in 1864
when Bishop Hobhouse, after accompanying
Selwyn on one of his journeys to the camp,
wrote the following description of what he
saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He was still obliged to provide for the chaplain&rsquo;s duties,
though the army was no longer massed, but was spread
into numerous out-posts stretching as far as ninety miles
from Auckland. This involved his starting every Friday
with such clerical companions as he could get; calling at
the various stations throughout Saturday to do any pastoral
duty required amongst the troops, and planning with the
officers how to make the most of his services on Sunday....
After forty-five miles we reached the Waikato river ...
when the steamer arrived it was found to be towing some
barges filled with the families of the new Australian settlers,
a corps which had been raised in the Australian towns....
The arrival of these families was an opportunity for pastoral
work.... The Bishop plunged into the barges.... One
woman, the mother of a family was nearing her end. He
induced the captain to put her on shore opposite to a
wooden church which had been riddled by shot and dismantled
in the war. Inside that inhospitable ruin he
proposed to stay the night as the comforter of the poor
woman, and bade me proceed to the nearest military post
and await his arrival. Early on the Saturday morning he
arrived after an unbroken night watch, during which he
had seen his poor patient&rsquo;s death, had committed her body
to the grave and had made arrangements for the charge of
her children. Without any sleep, he then hastened to
depart on foot to the missionary station, where we had been
expected overnight. During the many hours of the day
as we passed over the fields of action with their gloomy
records of ruined churches, abandoned paths, down-trodden
enclosures, the Bishop poured out his heart to me more
freely than was his wont. The scene was sad enough to
have overwhelmed him with acute regret and despondency
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
for the future. The Waikato tribe more than 10,000 strong,
the most advanced of the powerful tribes in civilization
and churchmanship, with churches and a complete set of
schools endowed by themselves, were now driven from their
fertile valley, estranged from British rule, and perhaps
alienated from the Christian faith. The missionary work
of forty years seemed all undone and the Bishop himself
was regarded as a traitor. Yet all these gloomy reflections
were put away, and his only thought was how to minister
to the new settlers now pouring in from the Australian
towns.... As we passed over the scene of bloodshed he
said: &lsquo;I have been in every action I could possibly reach.
It was my duty to minister to the wounded natives as well
as to the British.... Indeed I always ministered to the
fallen Maori first so as to give a practical answer to their
charge against me of forsaking and betraying them. It
was needful that I should be in the midst of each fray and
between two fires; but I was never hurt. I lay on the
ground at night and shared soldier&rsquo;s fare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst recalling all that he had gone through,
the Bishop&rsquo;s missionary zeal still enabled him
to make plans for fresh enterprises and to sketch
out new work amongst the settlers. But there
were thoughts poured out too about what he
could do when no longer fit for the active life
New Zealand demanded. He thought he might
best serve his Master by retiring to Canterbury,
and helping to train the next generation of
missionaries at St. Augustine&rsquo;s College. But the
time of retirement was not yet, and the next day
after a night spent sleeping on the ground, he
took eight separate services for the troops.</p>
<p>Many are the stories of his utter fearlessness
during the war. One settler years afterwards
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
wrote to an Auckland paper saying that he was
sure many of the settlers owed their lives to
Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s untiring watchfulness. He told
how once when returning to their homes at
Mauku, after a sudden flight, through fear of a
Maori attack, the Bishop appeared and, refusing
all refreshment, asked merely to be allowed to
leave his horse for the night. He said he must go
on at once to Purapura which was some nine miles
away, and to be reached only by a bush track;
that he needed no food as he had some bread
in his kit, but would probably be back next
morning. At 4 o&rsquo;clock next morning he duly
appeared, drenched to the skin, having walked
all through the night and having had to ford a
creek. He then told them that the day before
he had heard that a band of the fiercest Maoris
were on their way to attack the settlement, and
he had gone to see the chiefs assembled at
Purapura to persuade them to forbid their war
party to go on. This they had promised to do,
but said the Bishop, I will stay till all danger
from these wild spirits is past. During the
night he was up and out in a moment if there
was any unusual noise. The following Sunday
he held a service in the little schoolroom,
preaching a sermon never to be forgotten,
inspiring trust and confidence in God.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, Bishop Selwyn was
granted the same medal as was given to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
soldiers; and the officers and men among whom
he had ministered subscribed to give him money
to ornament his private chapel.</p>
<p>The prayer which he drew up to be used in
all the churches in New Zealand, deserves to
be recorded here as showing his inmost mind
about the war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord whose never failing Providence
ordereth all things both in heaven and earth,
we humbly beseech Thee to receive our prayer
for the Governor of this land and for all who are
in authority that they may be guided by Thee
in all things, that the dominion of our Queen
may be established in this land in justice and
mercy according to Thy Holy Will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We commend to Thee oh merciful Father
all our brethren who are gone forth from amongst
us to bear arms and to be exposed to the peril
of death, all who are thereby hindered from
worshipping Thee in Thy house, that Thou wilt
keep them from forgetfulness of Thee and of
Thy holy law: all who are sick, all who are
wounded, all who are drawing nigh unto death;
all who are bereaved. And we pray that Thy
Holy Spirit may so rule in all of us as to keep us
from every unbecoming and unchristian temper;
from all cruel, unmerciful and vindictive
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we beseech Thee, good Lord, to restrain
the evil passions of men, and to deliver this land
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
from the misery of strife and bloodshed and
to pour upon all the people of the land the spirit
of concord and obedience and peace. And this
we pray through Him who is the Prince of
Peace and Saviour of all men, our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to be noted that he did not bid them
pray for victory.</p>

<br /><span class="smaller">RETURN TO ENGLAND AND LAST YEARS</span></h2>
<p>The discovery of gold in the Southern Island
had brought such a rush of new settlers that it
seemed necessary to divide the Diocese of Christchurch
and form a new Diocese of Dunedin. All
were agreed about this, but unfortunately a
controversy arose as to the actual appointment
of the new Bishop. Selwyn, eager to see
someone appointed as quickly as possible,
wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, with
more definiteness than the Rural Deanery
Board at Dunedin was prepared for. The
Archbishop with unexpected promptitude,
appointed and consecrated Dr. Jenner, Bishop
of Dunedin, but the Rural Deanery were not
prepared for this, they said that the necessary
money had not yet been collected and refused
to recognise the appointment. This unfortunate
incident shows the difficulties that lay in
the way of the Colonial Church, and its relations
with the Home Church in the early days, before
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
experience had regulated the situation. During
the period of delay, Selwyn went himself to
Dunedin to try to promote the raising of the
money needed. In this way he saw the goldfields
and was able to judge of their needs.
He wrote from there (1866) describing the hurry
of the life, where everything had to be improvised
to meet the rush of new arrivals eager
for gold. &ldquo;The traffic seems to go on Sundays
and week-days alike, and a Scotchman whom I
invited in vain to church, admitted that all
the lessons of the old country were forgotten on
the road.... Upon the whole as the thing had
to be done I am not sorry to have had to go over
this province. Part of my object is to visit as
many of the diggers as I can and to hold services
wherever I find them disposed to attend. There
was a large party of them on board who assured
me that it was a mistake to suppose that there
were not many among them who cared for
better things than digging gold. They have
the character of being a manly and independent
body of men, for the most part orderly and
honest. It is a comfort to think that this is
the last work of bishop-making in which it will
be necessary for me to engage; and when this
is done I may break my wand.&rdquo; It is not
necessary to follow the long controversy over the
filling of the See of Dunedin, since after this the
matter did not really concern Bishop Selwyn.
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
It was not till 1871 that the difficulty was
settled and a Bishop appointed.</p>
<p>Writing to E. Coleridge at the end of 1865,
Bishop Selwyn had said: &ldquo;I do not see my
way to another visit to England. It is more
congenial to my present feelings to sit among
my own ruins, not moping, but tracing out the
outlines of a new foundation, than to go through
another course of public life in England. So
much has been said or written of late about my
order that I have begun to think it will be well
for us to be more sparing of our visits.&rdquo; When,
however, he received a summons from the
Archbishop of Canterbury to attend the first
conference of Bishops of the Anglican Communion,
which was to be held at Lambeth in
1867, he felt bound to go. He had always
regarded it as a duty to obey the orders of a
superior in the service to which he had given
his life, and his desire for the general restoration
of synodical government in the Church, made
him consider the proposed Lambeth Conference
as of supreme importance. He left his work
in New Zealand with deep regret and there was
much sorrow amongst his people at parting with
him even for a time, increased by a lurking
fear that he might never return. Before he
left, his friends met in the little Chapel at
Auckland for a last Communion together.
There were seventy communicants too many
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
for the chapel to hold and they overflowed into
the study behind. One who was there writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if there was a single dry eye in the chapel; and
the Bishop&rsquo;s voice at times was scarcely audible, for the
sobs which were heard on every hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a disappointment to Selwyn to find on
reaching England how little interest was shown
in the Lambeth Conference, how few even of the
clergy realized its importance. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From our distant point of view we look upon this
Conference as the most important opening for good which
has ever been offered to our Anglican Church; but I have
not yet seen any signs to lead me to believe that it is so
considered here. I have invitations to meetings of all
kinds up to the very day of the meeting, and the clergymen
who write to me do not seem to be aware that I came to
England for one object and that I am prepared to devote
all my time and attention to that, and that therefore I
must be free in mind and time to prepare for it beforehand,
and, after the meeting is over to work up its results.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Conference he was described as &ldquo;well
nigh the most conspicuous figure and certainly
the most attractive spirit there.&rdquo; Mrs. Selwyn
writes that he came back from the meetings
&ldquo;sometimes quite happy, and sometimes quite
desponding, the precious time being so frittered
away.&rdquo; He was distressed at &ldquo;the want of
previous arrangement, at the lack of all formality
or of anything to give dignity in the eyes
of the public or honour to the brethren.&rdquo;
After the Lambeth Conference, he went to the
Wolverhampton Church Congress. There he
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
had the support of other Bishops from overseas
in claiming that the Church in the Colonies
should have the right to manage its own affairs.
He himself spoke on Missions &ldquo;doubtful how
he could concentrate the lifetime of twenty-five
years into twenty-five minutes.&rdquo; He did express
the spirit in which he had worked when he
said: &ldquo;I do not know what failure means.&rdquo;
He ended with an earnest appeal for unity,
the appeal which comes with ever growing force
to the Church at home from the mission field,
and which again and again falls on deaf ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best assistance you can give to us in our
missionary work is to be united amongst yourselves....
I have learned in that great
Pacific, on which my islands lie like little gems,
to pray for the grace of God to distil from the
great ocean of the Catholic Church this essential
salt of unity, and with that salt to season all
sacrifices, whether prayer, praise or almsgiving,
and whether at home or abroad may that
sacrifice be acceptable to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after the Wolverhampton Congress,
the Bishop of Lichfield died and Lord Derby
asked Selwyn to be his successor. Selwyn
answered immediately that after having taken
counsel with no one but God in prayer: &ldquo;I
have been led to the conclusion that it is my
duty to return to New Zealand (1) Because the
native race to whose service I was first called,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
requires all the effort of the few friends that
remain to them; (2) Because the organization
of the Church in New Zealand is still incomplete;
(3) Because I have still so far as I can
judge, health and strength for the peculiar
duties which habit has made familiar to me;
(4) Because my bishopric is not endowed with
more than &pound;80 per annum and I have no reason
to expect that the C.M.S. will continue their
annual grant of &pound;400 to my successor.&rdquo; These
were the chief reasons he gave to Lord Derby
and he ended his letter with these words: &ldquo;I
could work with all my heart in the &lsquo;black
country&rsquo; if it were not that my heart is in New
Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was not allowed to rest there.
The Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to Selwyn
asking him to reconsider his decision. The
Queen sent for him and expressed her wish that
he would accept the bishopric. Selwyn then
wrote to the Archbishop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had no other reason for going (to New Zealand) than
because I was sent. Upon this question of obedience I
am still of the same mind. I am a man under authority....
As a soldier of the Church I shall probably feel bound
to do whatever my commander-in-chief bids me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To his dear friend, Sir W. Martin, he wrote first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My own desire to return to New Zealand is so strong, that
I cannot altogether trust my own judgment on a question
of conscience.... How I wish I could take counsel with
you. I have no one here, except Sarah (his wife), who can
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
even feel the force of the argument on the New Zealand side....
The point of obedience is the only one upon which I
see any light.... You may be sure that I shall not rest
until everything is made as sure as I can for my dear old
land if I am obliged to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month later, when he had felt it to be his
duty to obey commands and accept the bishopric
of Lichfield and all was settled, he wrote again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go to work immediately to raise an endowment
fund for the bishopric. Most of the furniture in the &lsquo;palace&rsquo;
will be left as an heirloom to the See, with the library.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had told the Archbishop before his appointment
that it would be absolutely necessary
for him &ldquo;to go back to New Zealand, if only
for a few weeks. Everything there was left at
short notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 9th, 1868, he was enthroned at
Lichfield and for more than a year he was Bishop
both of New Zealand and of Lichfield. How he
viewed his new work is shown by his determination
to give up at once Eccleshall Castle,
the house in the country twenty-five miles from
Lichfield in which his predecessors had lived,
and to settle in the old palace in the Cathedral
close. He set to work at once to visit the
forty-six rural deaneries in his immense diocese,
in order to gain some idea of what his work would
be, and he began to lay plans for synodical
organization in the diocese. <i>Punch</i> had some
verses about his appointment in which it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
said that he had been called &ldquo;to his work among
savages this side the main,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the Black country, darker than ever New Zealand</p>
<p class="t0">Mid worse ills than heathenism&rsquo;s worst can combine,</p>
<p class="t0">He must strive with the savages reared in our free land.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He sailed for New Zealand in the summer and
reached Auckland in time for the General Synod
of the Province in October, when six Bishops
were present. Patteson was there, having
come from Melanesia in the <i>Southern Cross</i>,
filled with intense grief at the prospect of losing
Bishop Selwyn. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever quite felt till now, what you have
been to me for many a long year,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but he went on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly clear to my mind that you could not have
done otherwise. I don&rsquo;t grudge you to the mother Church
one atom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his address to the Synod, Selwyn dwelt upon
the advantages of the independent position of
the Church. &ldquo;I earnestly entreat you as one
who has seen the work of the Church on both
sides of the world, hold fast to your voluntary
compact: make it as perfect as you can:
seek for Communion with all branches of our
Anglican Church now scattered over the world:
aim at one common standard of faith and
ritual in all essential points, treasure up the
memory of all the blessings and privileges which
we have inherited from our Holy Mother, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
it may be seen that by none is she more honoured
and beloved than by the most distant of her
children.&rdquo; The address which was presented
to him by the Synod shows how he was regarded.
It is only possible to quote some sentences from
it. &ldquo;It seems as if you had been sent first to
warn the most distant members here, and were
called now to quicken the very heart of our dear
mother Church at home, so that the life blood
may circulate with fresh vigour throughout the
body. How can we ever forget you? Every
spot in New Zealand is identified with you.
Each hill and valley, each river and bay and
headland is full of memories of you; the busy
town, the lonely settlers&rsquo; hut, the countless
islands of the sea, all speak to us of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An address from the Maoris in the Waimate
was brought to him by their own Maori Priest
which said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sire our thought with regard to you is that you are like
the poor man&rsquo;s lamb, taken away by the rich man....
Go, Sire, we shall no more see each other in the body, but
we shall see one another in our thoughts. However we are
led and protected and sanctified by the same Spirit....
This is our lament for you in a few words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love to our friend who has disappeared abruptly from the ranks!</p>
<p class="t0">Is he a small man that he was so beloved?</p>
<p class="t0">He has not his equal among the many.</p>
<p class="t0">The food he dispensed is longed for by me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The general Maori address said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;You leave here these two peoples&mdash;the Maoris and the
Europeans.... Go to your own country; go, the grace
of God accompany you. Go on the face of the deep waters.
Father take hence with you the commandments of God
leaving the peoples here bewildered. Who can tell that
after your departure things will be as well with us as during
your stay in this island. Our love for you and our remembrance
of you will never cease ...&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selwyn left New Zealand full of hope for its
future, confident that the Maori Church would
revive and that &ldquo;The remnant is taking root
downwards and bearing fruit upwards.&rdquo; He
exhorted his Synod not to forget that remnant
of the faithful Christian Maoris, saying that no
increase of European population should make
them &ldquo;forget that it is still a remnant in the
great congregation of Christ.&rdquo; His departure
from Auckland was a sort of triumph. All
shops were shut, and he and Mrs. Selwyn, who
was raised up aloft in a high seat, were dragged
by four horses to the pier in a brilliantly coloured
triumphal car, amidst the hurrahs of the excited
people, the Bishop stretching out his hand for a
last shake as he passed through them.</p>
<p>The pain of parting did not prevent him from
looking on with eagerness to the work which
lay before him. At Sydney he wrote to his dear
friend, Judge Martin, and told how he had
watched for the last time the familiar landmarks
of the coast as he passed them, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And then the thought came upon me with great bitterness
that I should never see the dear old land again. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
the mind has now settled down upon its new bearings, and
the magnet of English interests and work begins to draw
me on.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six months after he had left England he was
back again, and at the age of 59 he settled down
to the great new work that lay before him.
With the details of that work we are not here
concerned. During the ten years of his work as
Bishop of Lichfield, he showed the same unbounded
energy and devotion which had
characterised his life in New Zealand. The
experience gained there was turned to account
in all he did and planned. From his clergy he
demanded the same energy and devotion to work
which he showed himself. He gave much
attention to the training of the clergy and to
the development of the Theological College
which had been established at Lichfield. Sometimes
he was considered exacting and hard
because he demanded and expected so much of
others. He had no patience with slackness
and was not one to tolerate excuses. When a
student to whom he remarked: &ldquo;I have not
seen you at chapel lately,&rdquo; answered, &ldquo;No,
my Lord, I have had a bad cold,&rdquo; he retorted:
&ldquo;I think your cold must have been bad since
the beginning of term.&rdquo; Always exact and
punctual in keeping engagements himself, he
could not tolerate failure in this respect in
others. But the students recognized his anxiety
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
to help each one in the College and knew that
he was unsparing of his time in guiding their
studies. One of them writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We felt as we went forth to our work that we knew our
Bishop, and that he knew us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The missionary spirit which had inspired
him in his work in New Zealand and Melanesia,
found its opportunity in the work he did in the
Potteries and the dark places of his diocese.
It was inspired alike in the Pahs of the Maoris,
in the Pacific islands and the slums of England,
by his profound conviction that under every
human skin God has planted a human heart,
and that it is the business of God&rsquo;s servants to
go and find it. So he visited workhouses,
gaols and infirmaries, and started a barge mission
amongst the people on the canals.</p>
<p>Many great questions agitated the Church
during the ten years of Selwyn&rsquo;s English
episcopate, and in all of them he took active
part. He laboured especially to make the
Councils of the Church a reality and to bring
about that Synodical government which he had
always believed to be so desirable. In consequence,
he used his influence to promote a
second Lambeth Conference, as a means of
bringing into close federation all the branches
of the Anglican Church. But as was to be
expected what lay nearest to his heart was to
make his Church a really missionary Church.
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
When he first came to Lichfield he found that
about two-thirds of the parishes in his diocese
did nothing for foreign missions, but he soon
made Lichfield a centre of missionary activity
for the whole Church and the place to which
missionaries from far distant lands looked for
help and counsel. No fewer than five missionary
bishops were chosen from among the clergy
in the Diocese. In 1871 at the invitation of the
American Church, Selwyn went to the Triennial
Convention held at Baltimore. Intercourse
between the different branches of the Anglican
Church was not then so close and intimate as
Selwyn longed for it to be and as it has since
become, partly through what he himself was
able to accomplish. During the Convention,
the American Board of Missions held its Jubilee,
and to it Selwyn gave one of his great missionary
addresses. He spoke of the coldness and backwardness
shown in regard to Christian missions,
which he attributed in part to the imputation
of failure and asserted that there is no such thing
as failure in the works of God, and asked how
with the feeble efforts made, we could hope to
evangelise the world; in part also he attributed
this backwardness to the idea that there
were races incapable of being taught, and contradicted
this error by asserting &ldquo;that there is
not one single being on the face of God&rsquo;s earth,
who is shut out from the promises of the Gospel
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
by any difference of intellectual or of moral
capacity.&rdquo; This belief he was able to illustrate
from his own experience. The success of
missions he attributed to the fact that &ldquo;missionaries
had been found who, instead of expecting
wild men to conform to ours have made our
habits conformable to theirs, who have followed
them from place to place and won their confidence,
who have lived the same rough lives
that they have lived.&rdquo; He told the Americans
of the immense privilege that was theirs, owing
to their vast population, of undertaking the
charge of the larger nations of the earth. The
Bishop of Quebec, who was present on this
occasion, spoke of it as the grandest missionary
meeting he had ever witnessed, and said that
Selwyn held the magnificent audience under the
spell of his burning thoughts.</p>
<p>It was after Selwyn&rsquo;s return from America,
that he heard in the year 1871, the crushing news
of the murder of Bishop Patteson in one of the
Melanesian Islands. Patteson was dear to him
as a son, he called him the most perfect of men,
and the news which he felt to be so disastrous
for the Melanesian Mission seemed to make him
at once ten years older. Patteson&rsquo;s death bore
abundant fruit, for it attracted attention to the
cause in which so gifted a man had laid down his
life. Those who had scoffed at missions were
forced to think, and when we compare the way
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
in which they were spoken of by Sidney Smith
with the estimation in which they are held now,
we can believe that the death of the martyr
bishop was one of the causes of the change. Two
years afterwards, Selwyn&rsquo;s own son went out to
work in the Pacific and in 1877 was chosen by
the General Synod of New Zealand to be Bishop
of Melanesia.</p>
<p>It is impossible here to give any account of
Bishop Selwyn&rsquo;s many activities and interests
during these last busy years of his life. He
never spared himself, nor sought the ease and
comfort which he had long learned to do without.
Sometimes his indignation with those unwilling
to face hard work and self-denial showed itself
in sharp and hasty words, which he afterwards
regretted, for he was really one of the
meekest and tenderest of men. To one whom
he had reproved perhaps too sharply for
neglected work he said: &ldquo;I seem Sir, to have
two duties to perform, first to take you down and
then to take myself down.&rdquo; Sir William Martin
who had so closely watched his work in New
Zealand wrote of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To him work was no drudgery. He was the willing
servant of a loving master; paying little regard to praise
from men, rather turning aside from it, and giving to others
the credit of what he had done or spoken well. There was
no moroseness or asceticism about his religion. He enjoyed
as few do, the beauty of the world. Being strong
in faith he was daring, direct and fearless; stern too, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
sternness was needed; yet withal tender as a woman to the
sick, the suffering, the penitent and to children.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March 1878 his splendid strength began
to fail. But, though weak and suffering, he
would not give in, and held a Confirmation at
Shrewsbury on the 24th. When in the vestry
someone remarked on the vigour he had shown,
he answered: &ldquo;Yes, but it was like holding on
to a ship in a storm. I held on by my hands
and feet.&rdquo; Sinking into a chair he added,
&ldquo;The end is come.&rdquo; This confirmation was his
last public act. He went back to Lichfield the
next day. Then came days of weakness and
suffering during which he still followed the work
going on in his diocese, and bade farewell to
those near and dear to him. In his wanderings
he thought of the work to be done and said:
&ldquo;I ought to be there, I fear I am getting idle.&rdquo;
When Sir William Martin came to see him, he
turned to thoughts of New Zealand days. His
beloved Maoris were present to his mind and
he repeated several times &ldquo;They will all come
back.&rdquo; Maori words rose to his lips in his
wanderings and almost his last words were in
Maori, &ldquo;It is light.&rdquo; He died on April 11th,
1878, glad to pass from his work to that fuller
light in which he so fervently believed.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
